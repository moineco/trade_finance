# Preface {.unnumbered}

International Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. 'International Trade' is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. 'International Finance' is largely conceptualized in terms of 'open-economy macroeconomics' which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.

The aim of "International Trade and International Finance" course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher--Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.

Increasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
