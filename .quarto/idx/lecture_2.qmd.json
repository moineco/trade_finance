{"title":"Introduction to International Trade","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction to International Trade","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## The gains from trade\n\n-   Probably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit.\n\n-   Although nations generally gain from international trade, it is quite possible that international trade may hurt particular groups within nations---in other words, that international trade will have strong effects on the distribution of income.\n\n> Trade can alter the distribution of income between workers and the owners of capital.\n\n## The pattern of trade\n\n-   Some aspects of the pattern of trade are easy to understand. Climate and resources clearly explain why Brazil exports coffee and Saudi Arabia exports oil.\n\n-   Why does Japan export automobiles, while the United States exports aircraft?\n\n-   There are various different models that try to explain the reason behind the pattern of trade.\n\n> \"Who sells what to whom\" have been a major question of international economics.\n\n## Determinants of trade\n\n-   After World War II the advanced democracies, led by the United States, pursued a broad policy of removing barriers to international trade; this policy reflected the view that free trade was a force not only for prosperity but also for promoting world peace.\n\n-   In 2016, Britain shocked the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, which guarantees free movement of goods and people among its members.\n\n> Conflicts of interest within nations are usually more important in determining trade policy than conflicts of interest between nations.\n\n## Balance of payments\n\n-   The balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (\"BOP\"). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.\n\n-   The balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.\n\n    -   The current account (CA) includes a nation's net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.\n\n    -   The capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation's transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.\n\n    -   The sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.\n\n> The BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982.\n\n## What is trade?\n\n-   Buying and selling goods and services from other countries. Trade consist of imports (M) and exports (X). For instance, in the context of Japan:\n\n    -   The purchase of goods and services from abroad that leads to an outflow of currency from Japan -- Imports (IM)\n    -   The sale of goods and services to buyers from other countries leading to an inflow of currency to Japan -- Exports (EX)\n\n## Labor Intensive and capital intensive industries\n\n### What Is labor intensive industry?\n\n-   The term labor intensive refers to a process or industry that requires a large amount of labor to produce its goods or services.\n\n-   The degree of labor intensity is typically measured in proportion to the amount of capital required to produce the goods or services: the higher the proportion of labor costs required, the more labor-intensive the business.\n\n-   Labor-intensive industries include restaurants, hotels, agriculture, mining, as well as healthcare and caregiver.\n\n-   Less developed economies, as a whole, tend to be more labor-intensive. This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\n\n-   Before the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n**Brain storming**\n\n-   Japan is facing a continuous reduction of birth rate and increase in ageing population. This trend is adversely impacting on labor intensive sectors. For instance as healthcare and caregiver sector is suffering from the shortage of skilled labor in this sector. As a policy maker, what type of changes you will suggest.\n\n### What is capital intensive industry?\n\n-   Capital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\n\n-   Capital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\n\n-   Good examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n### Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\n-   Capital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\n\n-   Capital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\n\n-   Labor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\n###
