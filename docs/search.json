    "text": "Preface\nInternational Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.\nThe aim of “International Trade and International Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO)."

This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\nBrain storming\n\nJapan is facing a continuous reduction of birth rate and increase in ageing population. This trend is adversely impacting on labor intensive sectors. For instance as healthcare and caregiver sector is suffering from the shortage of skilled labor in this sector.

    "section": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith",
    "text": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage, developed by Adam Smith. He started with the simple truth that for two nations to trade with each other voluntarily, both nations must gain. If one nation gained nothing or lost, it would simply refuse to trade. But how does this mutually beneﬁcial trade take place, and from where do these gains from trade come?\nAccording to Adam Smith, trade between two nations is based on absolute advantage. When one nation is more efﬁcient than (or has an absolute advantage over) another in the production of one commodity but is less efﬁcient than (or has an absolute disadvantage with respect to) the other nation in producing a second commodity, then both nations can gain by each specializing in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of its output with the other nation for the commodity of its absolute disadvantage.\nBy this process, resources are utilized in the most efﬁcient way and the output of both commodities will rise. This increase in the output of both commodities measures the gains from specialization in production available to be divided between the two nations through trade.\nFor example, because of climatic conditions, Canada is efﬁcient in growing wheat but inefﬁcient in growing bananas (hothouses would have to be used). On the other hand, Nicaragua is efﬁcient in growing bananas but inefﬁcient in growing wheat. Thus, Canada has an absolute advantage over Nicaragua in the cultivation of wheat but an absolute dis- advantage in the cultivation of bananas. The opposite is true for Nicaragua.\nUnder these circumstances, both nations would beneﬁt if each specialized in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and then traded with the other nation. Canada would specialize in the production of wheat (i.e., produce more than needed domestically) and exchange some of it for (surplus) bananas grown in Nicaragua. As a result, both more wheat and more bananas would be grown and consumed, and both Canada and Nicaragua would gain.\nThus, while the mercantilism believed that one nation could gain only at the expense of another nation and advocated strict government control of all economic activity and trade, Adam Smith (and the other classical economists who followed him) believed that all nations would gain from free trade and strongly advocated a policy of laissez-faire (i.e., as little government interference with the economic system as possible).\nFree trade would cause world resources to be utilized most efﬁciently and would maximize world welfare. There were to be only a few exceptions to this policy of laissez-faire and free trade. One of these was the protection of industries important for national defense.\n\n\nIn view of this belief, it seems paradoxical that today most nations impose many restrictions on the free ﬂow of international trade.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example of absolute advantage:\n\none hour of labor time produces six kilograms of wheat in the United States but only one in the United Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, one hour of labor time produces ﬁve units of cloths in the United Kingdom but only four in the United States.\nThus, the United States is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United Kingdom in the production of wheat, whereas the United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United States in the production of cloth.\nWith trade, the United States would specialize in the production of wheat and exchange part of it for British cloth. The opposite is true for the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 3.1: Absolute advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage, however, can explain only a very small part of world trade today, such as some of the trade between developed and developing countries. Most of world trade, especially trade among developed countries, could not be explained by absolute advantage."

The ﬁrst nation should specialize in the production and export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (this is the commodity of its comparative advantage) and import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is greater.\nThe statement of the law can be clariﬁed by looking at Table 3.2. The only difference between Tables 3.2 and 3.1 is that the United Kingdom now produces only two units of cloth per hour instead of ﬁve. Thus, the United Kingdom now has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both wheat and cloth with respect to the United States.\nHowever, since U.K. labor is half as productive in cloth but six times less productive in wheat with respect to the United States, the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in cloth.\nOn the other hand, the United States has an absolute advantage in both wheat and cloth with respect to the United Kingdom, but since its absolute advantage is greater in wheat (6:1) than in cloth (4:2), the United States has a comparative advantage in wheat.\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, both nations can gain if the United States specializes in the production of wheat and exports some of it in exchange for British cloth. At the same time, the United Kingdom is specializing in the production and exporting of cloth.\n\nTable 3.2: Comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n2"

But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier."

All choices on the PPF in this graph, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\nAllocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand.

Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as:\n\nImport quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports)\nExport restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request).\n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies."

    "text": "6.2 Political economy and trade policy\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand, Russia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only politically improper, as it serves only one country’s interest, but also economically counter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around €90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically, due to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere for sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies produce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to hoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions that go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n6.2.1 Free Trade and Efficiency\nThe efficiency case for free trade is simply the reverse of the cost-benefit analysis of a tariff. Figure 6a shows the basic point once again for the case of a small country that cannot influence foreign export prices. A tariff causes a net loss to the economy measured by the area of the two triangles; it does so by distorting the economic incentives of both producers and consumers. Conversely, a move to free trade eliminates these distortions and increases national welfare.\n\n\n\nFigure 6a: Efficiency of free trade\n\n\nIn the modern world, for reasons we will explain later in this chapter, tariff rates are generally low and import quotas relatively rare. As a result, estimates of the total costs of distortions due to tariffs and import quotas tend to be modest in size. Table 6a shows an estimate of the gains from a move to worldwide free trade, measured as a percentage of GDP. For the world as a whole, according to these estimates, protection costs less than 1 percent of GDP. The gains from free trade are somewhat smaller for advanced economies such as the United States and Europe and somewhat larger for poorer “developing countries.”\n\nTable 6.1: Benefits of Free Trade (Source: William Cline, Trade Policy and Global Poverty)\n\n\nCountry or region\nGrowth of GDP in percentage\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n0.57\n\n\nEuropean Union\n0.61\n\n\nJapan\n0.85\n\n\nDeveloping Countries\n1.4\n\n\nWorld\n0.93\n\n\n\nBecause tariff rates are already low for most of the countries, the estimated benefit to free trade is not significantly high for many nations and regions of the world.\n\nTable 6b: Effects of Alternative Trade Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\nTariff\nExport Subsidy\nImport Quota\nVoluntary Export Restraint\n\n\n\n\nProducer benefit\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\n\n\nConsumer benefit\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\n\n\nGovernment revenue\nIncreases\nFalls\nNo change\nNo change\n\n\nOverall national welfare\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\n\n\n\nAll four trade policies benefit producers and hurt consumers.

Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.\n\n\n6.3.2 Import Quotas\nAn import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm’s quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past.\n\n\n6.3.3 Voluntary Export Restraints\nA variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country’s side instead of the importer’s. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981.\n\n\n6.3.4 Local Content Requirements\nA local content requirement is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added. Local content laws have been widely used by developing countries trying to shift their manufacturing base from assembly back into intermediate goods.\n\n\n6.3.5 Quiz 6\nWhy some developing countries impose high import tariff on car? Explain the reasons with sufficient justification and examples."

The classic example is the European telecommunications industry. For instance, I Europe, government-owned telephone companies buy from domestic suppliers even when the suppliers charge higher prices than suppliers in other countries.\n\n\n\nSometimes a government wants to restrict imports without doing so formally. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is easy to twist normal health, safety, and customs procedures in order to place substantial obstacles in the way of trade."

FTAs can help your company to enter and compete more easily in the global marketplace through zero or reduced tariffs and other provisions.

    "text": "7.4 The Infant Industry Argument\n\nAccording to the infant industry argument, developing countries have a potential comparative advantage in manufacturing, but new manufacturing industries in developing countries cannot initially compete with well-established manufacturing in developed countries.\nTo allow manufacturing to get a toehold, then, governments should temporarily support new industries until they have grown strong enough to meet international competition. Thus, it makes sense, according to this argument, to use tariffs or import quotas as temporary measures to get industrialization started.\n\n\n7.4.1 Problems with the Infant Industry Argument\nThe infant industry argument seems highly plausible, and in fact it has been persuasive to many governments. Yet economists have pointed out many pitfalls in the argument, suggesting that it must be used cautiously.\n\nFirst, it is not always a good idea to try to move today into the industries that will have a comparative advantage in the future. Suppose a country that is currently labor-abundant is in the process of accumulating capital. When it accumulates enough capital, it will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries. However, that does not mean it should try to develop these industries immediately.\nSecond, protecting manufacturing does no good unless the protection itself helps make industry competitive. For example, Pakistan and India have protected their manufacturing sectors for decades and have recently begun to develop significant exports of manufactured goods. The goods they export, however, are light manufactures like textiles, not the heavy manufactures that they protected; a good case can be made that they would have developed their manufactured exports even if they had never protected manufacturing.\nMore generally, the fact that it is costly and time-consuming to build up an industry is not an argument for government intervention unless there is some domestic market failure.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n\n\nFigure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries\n\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition.

    "text": "8.2 Case: India’s ecoonomic growth\nIndia, with a population of more than 1.1 billion people, is the world’s second-most-populous country. It’s also a growing force in world trade especially in new forms of trade that involve information rather than physical goods. The Indian city of Bangalore has become famous for its growing role in the global information technology industry.\nYet a generation ago, India was a very minor player in world trade. In part this was because the country’s economy performed poorly in general: Until about 1980, India eked out a rate of economic growth—sometimes mocked as the “Hindu rate of growth”—that was only about 1 percentage point higher than population growth. This slow growth was widely attributed to the stifling effect of bureaucratic restrictions. Observers spoke of a “license Raj”: Virtually any kind of business initiative required hard-to-get government permits, which placed a damper on investment and innovation. And India’s sluggish economy participated little in world trade.\nAfter the country achieved independence in 1948, its leaders adopted a particularly extreme form of import-substituting industrialization as the country’s development strategy: India imported almost nothing that it could produce domestically, even if the domestic product was far more expensive and of lower quality than what could be bought abroad. High costs, in turn, crimped exports. So India was a very “closed” economy. In the 1970s, imports and exports averaged only about 5 percent of GDP, close to the lowest levels of any major nation.\nThen everything changed. India’s growth accelerated dramatically: GDP per-capita, which had risen at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent from 1960 to 1980, has grown at close to 4 percent annually since 1980. And India’s participation in world trade surged as tariffs were brought down and import quotas were removed. In short, India has become a high-performance economy. It’s still a very poor country, but it is rapidly growing richer and has begun to rival China as a focus of world attention.\nThe big question, of course, is why India’s growth rate has increased so dramatically. That question is the subject of heated debate among economists. Some have argued that trade liberalization, which allowed India to participate in the global economy, was crucial. Others point out that India’s growth began accelerating around 1980, whereas the big changes in trade policy didn’t occur until the beginning of the 1990s.\nWhatever caused the change, India’s transition has been a welcome development. More than a billion people now have much greater hope for a decent standard of living.\n\n8.2.1 The Rising Weight of Developing Countries in World Trade\n\nDeveloping countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\nThe share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise—its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n\nTrade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 The Rise of South-South Trade\n\nOver the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly—though not exclusively—involving Asian nations.\nChina and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing $32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just $545 million in 1996.\nBilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from $686 million to $14.5 billion.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9a: Environmental Kuznet Curve\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive “inverted U” relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\nThe idea is that as a country’s income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\nBut when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment.

    "text": "9.2 What does Kuznet Curve have to do with international trade?\n\nTrade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve—that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\nHowever, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it’s fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment—at least so far.\nThis argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.\nChina’s boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It’s important to realize, though, that the problem here isn’t globalization per se—it’s China’s economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it’s difficult to argue that China’s growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9c: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)"

    "text": "9.3 The Problem of “Pollution Havens”\nWhen ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their scrap metal and other materials. One way to look at “shipbreaking” is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a shipbreaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect shipbreaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals impose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\nThus, to the extent that Indian shipbreaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation."

    "text": "9.4 The Carbon Tariff Dispute\nIn 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases—that is, a system under which a limited number of emissions licenses are issued and firms are required to buy enough licenses to cover their actual emissions, in effect putting a price on carbon dioxide and other gases. The Senate failed to pass any comparable bill, so climate-change legislation is on hold for the time being. Nonetheless, there was a key trade provision in the House bill that may represent the shape of things to come: It imposed carbon tariffs on imports from countries that fail to enact similar policies.\nThe idea behind carbon tariffs is to charge importers of goods from countries without climate-change policies an amount proportional to the carbon dioxide emitted in the production of those goods. The charge per ton of emissions would be equal to the price of carbon dioxide emission licenses in the domestic market. This would give overseas producers an incentive to limit their carbon emissions and would remove the incentive to shift production to countries with lax regulation. In addition, it would, possibly, give countries with lax regulations an incentive to adopt climate-change policies of their own.\nAt this point, the issue of carbon tariffs is hypothetical, since no major economy has yet placed a significant price on greenhouse gas emissions. Correspondingly, the WTO hasn’t issued any rulings on the legality of such tariffs, and probably won’t until or unless a real case emerges. But if climate-change legislation makes a comeback—and it is a good bet that it will sooner or later—it will clearly lead to some major new issues in trade policy."

    "text": "We are so accustomed to using money that we seldom notice the roles it plays in almost all of our everyday transactions. As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.\n\n\n\n\nThe most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade—the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services.\nMoney eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable.\nA complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney’s second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value.\nPrices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries’ money prices into comparable terms.\nThe convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.\nMoney’s usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets.vSince money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn economy’s money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow individual households and firms determine their demands for money? Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:\n\n\nThe interest rate: A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money.\nThe price level: The economy’s price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.\nReal national income: When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level."

All else equal, a depreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods cheaper for foreigners. All else equal, an appreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods more expensive for foreigners.\n\n12.2.1 The Foreign Exchange Market\nThe market in which international currency trades take place is called the foreign exchange market.\n\n12.2.1.1 The Actors\nThe major participants in the foreign exchange market are commercial banks, corporations that engage in international trade, non-bank financial institutions such as asset management firms and insurance companies, and central banks.\nI now describe the major actors in the market and their roles.\n\nCommercial banks: Commercial banks are at the center of the foreign exchange market because almost every sizable international transaction involves the debiting and crediting of accounts at commercial banks in various financial centers. Thus, the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions involve the exchange of bank deposits denominated in different currencies.\nCorporations: Corporations with operations in several countries frequently make or receive payments in currencies other than that of the country in which they are headquartered. To pay workers at a plant in Mexico, for example, IBM may need Mexican pesos. If IBM has only dollars earned by selling computers in the United States, it can acquire the pesos it needs by buying them with its dollars in the foreign exchange market.\nNon-bank financial institutions: Over the years, deregulation of financial markets in the United States, Japan, and other countries has encouraged non-bank financial institutions such as mutual funds to offer their customers a broader range of services, many of them indistinguishable from those offered by banks. Among these have been services involving foreign exchange transactions. Institutional investors such as pension funds often trade foreign currencies. So do insurance companies. Hedge funds, which cater to very wealthy individuals and are not bound by the government regulations that limit mutual funds’ trading strategies, trade actively in the foreign exchange market.\nCentral banks: In the last chapter, we learned that central banks sometimes intervene in foreign exchange markets. While the volume of central bank transactions is typically not large, the impact of these transactions may be great. The reason for this impact is that participants in the foreign exchange market watch central bank actions closely for clues about future macroeconomic policies that may affect exchange rates. Government agencies other than central banks may also trade in the foreign exchange market, but central banks are the most regular official participants."

    "text": "Do you think that geography is important in influencing economic and political institutions, and ultimately poverty?\n\n13.0.1 Geography matters\nInternational trade is important for growth, and ocean harbors and a lack of geographical barriers foster trade with foreign markets.\n\nLandlocked and mountainous regions are predicted to be poor.\nAlso, geography is said to have determined institutions, which may play a role in development.\nGeography determined whether Westerners established property rights and long-term investment in colonies, which in turn influenced economic growth.\nGeography determined whether Westerners died from malaria and other diseases. With high mortality rates, they established practices and institutions based on quick plunder of colonies’ resources, rather than institutions favoring long-term economic growth.\nPlunder led to property confiscation and corruption, even after political independence from Westerners.\nGeography also determined whether local economies were better for plantation agriculture, which resulted in income inequalities and political inequalities. Under this system, equal property rights were not established, hindering long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\n13.0.2 Geography and transportation\nGeography and economy are closely tied together because transport makes trade with widespread areas possible. This is because geographical features include mountains, deserts, and water, which directly impact the movement of people and thus the movement of trade. The integration of the world economy has increased rapidly in recent decades, with world trade growing more than twice as fast as world GDP since 1980. The two main reasons behind it are\n\nTrade liberalization\nDecline in trade costs (including transport and communication costs)\n\n\n\n13.0.3 Globalization and international trade\nIn a global economy, no nation is self-sufficient, which is associated with specific flows of goods, people, and information. International trade, or long-distance trade, has taken place for centuries, with some ancient trade routes predating history. Trade is an important part of economic and cultural history, as ancient trade routes such as the Silk Road can testify.\n\n\n13.0.4 The Silk Road\nThe Silk Road was the most enduring trade route in human history, being used for about 1,500 years. Its name is taken from the prized Chinese textile that flowed from Asia to the Middle East and Europe, although many other commodities were traded along the route. The Silk Road consisted of a succession of trails followed by caravans through Central Asia, about 6,400 km in length.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, trade was taking an increasingly active role in the economic life of nations and regions, and after the mid-20th century, trade became an active tool of economic globalization.\n\nThe Silk Road was a vast trade network connecting Eurasia and North Africa via land and sea routes.\nThe Silk Road earned its name from Chinese silk, a highly valued commodity that merchants transported along these trade networks.\nAdvances in technology and increased political stability caused an increase in trade. The opening of more trade routes caused travelers to exchange many things: animals, spices, ideas, and diseases.\n\n\n\n13.0.4.1 Travel on the Silk Road\n\nTraders had to find ways to move their goods efficiently. To travel overland, the camel was favored mode of transportation.\nNomadic peoples in central Asia started domesticating camels as early as the second millennium BCE. For example, the Han Chinese used camels captured from the Xiongnu to carry military supplies.\nCamels could withstand the harsh desert conditions through central Asia and were also able to carry up to 500 pounds at a time! Pack animals—especially camels—made the transportation of goods over land on the Silk Road viable.\n\n\n\n13.0.4.2 The effects of exchange\nOne obvious effect of trade along the Silk Road was more goods were available in more places. Silk, owing to its soft texture and appealing shimmer, became so hotly desired that it was used as currency in central Asia. However, the process of raising silkworms and creating fabric from their cocoons remained a Chinese secret through the 6th century C.E. The fact that China remained the only source of silk meant that trade goods continued to travel across Asia. This involved many people and locations in the Silk Road trade networks.\n\n\n13.0.4.3 Chinese silk in Rome\nSo now we have a sense of the economic and political conditions that enabled Chinese silk to make its way to Roman markets. Both the Han Chinese and Roman Empires controlled vast territories and kept them relatively peaceful. The Han conquered their way into central Asia. From there, nomadic traders carried goods farther west or south. Trade brought new faiths, new ideas, and new goods to places they had not previously been.\n\n\n\n13.0.5 Living in cities\nRoughly two thirds of the world’s population is projected to live in cities by the year 2050, with the urban population increasing by around 2.5 billion people, and nearly 90 percent of this increase concentrated in Asia and Africa.\nHow do people and economic activities sort across geographic space in response?\n\n\n13.0.6 The China shock\nWith its rapid economic growth following its market-orientated reforms of 1978, China has emerged as a major source of import competition for producers of manufactured goods in developed countries such as the United States.\nIn 1991, low-income countries accounted for just 9 percent of U.S. manufacturing imports. In contrast, by 2000, the low-income country share of U.S. imports reached 15 percent and climbed to 28 percent by 2007, with China accounting for 89 percent of this growth.\nThis rise in import penetration is particularly rapid following China’s admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and coincides with a marked decline in U.S. manufacturing"

The classifications are updated each year on July 1 and are based on the GNI per capita of the previous year (2021). GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nLow income: most sub-Saharan Africa, India, Pakistan\nLower-middle income: China, Caribbean countries\nUpper-middle income: Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Africa, Czech Republic\nHigh income: U.S., Singapore, France, Japan, Kuwait\n\n\n\n15.0.2 Has the world income gap narrowed over time?\nWhile some previously middle- and low-income economies have grown faster than high-income countries, and thus have “caught up” with high- income countries, others have languished. The income levels of high-income countries and some previously middle-income and low-income countries have converged. But the some of the poorest countries have had the lowest growth rates.\n\n15.0.2.1 Inequality within countries: Gini index\nThe Gini index is a measure of how equal a country’s distribution of income is. It is a score between 0 and 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. Perfect equality means a country’s total income is shared equally among its residents, whereas perfect inequality means a country’s total income is owned by a single individual.\nFor example, you can see that South Africa is (by this measure) the most unequal country in the world with a Gini index of 0.63\n\n\n15.0.2.2 Inequality between countries\nOver the last two decades global inequalities between countries have declined, income inequality has increased within most countries. Inequality varies significantly between the most equal region (Europe) and the most unequal (Middle East and North Africa i.e. “MENA”). In Europe, the top 10% income share is around 36%, whereas in “MENA” it reaches 58%. In between these two levels, we see a diversity of patterns. In East Asia, the top 10% makes 43% of total income and in Latin America, 55%.\n\n\n\nFigure: Income inequality levels across the regions\n\n\n\n\n15.0.2.3 How bad is extreme poverty globally?\nIt is true that ~700 million people around the world live on less than $1.90 USD per day. This forces people to make impossible choices for themselves and their families regarding healthcare, food, water, education, and housing. As a result, ~14,500 children under the age of five die every day from completely preventable causes, such as malaria, diarrhea, or malnutrition.\n\n\n15.0.2.4 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on income inequality\n2020 marked the steepest increase in the global billionaires’ share of wealth on record, the report found. Indeed, since 1995, the share of global wealth owned by billionaires’ has risen from 1% to over 3%.\n\n\n\n15.0.3 Structural features of developing countries\nWhat causes poverty is a difficult question, but low-income countries have at least some of following characteristics, which could contribute to poverty:\n\nGovernment control of the economy\n\n\nRestrictions on trade\nDirect control of production in industries and a high level of government purchases relative to GNP\nDirect control of financial transactions\nReduced competition reduces innovation; lack of market prices prevents efficient allocation of resources\n\n\nUnsustainable macroeconomic policies that cause high inflation and unstable output and employment\n\n\nIf governments cannot pay for debts through taxes, they can print money to finance debts.\nSeigniorage is paying for real goods and services by printing money.\nSeigniorage generally leads to high inflation.\nHigh inflation reduces the real cost of debt that the government has to repay and reduces the real value of repayments for lenders.\nHigh and variable inflation is costly to society; unstable output and employment is also costly.\n\n\nLack of financial markets that allow transfer of funds from savers to borrowers\n\n\nBanks frequently lend funds to poor or risky projects.\nLoans may be made on the basis of personal connections rather than prospective returns, and government safeguards against financial fragility, such as bank supervision, tend to be ineffective due to incompetence, inexperience, and outright fraud.\nUsually harder in developing countries for shareholders to find out how a firm’s money is being spent or to control firm managers.\nThe legal framework for resolving asset ownership in cases of bankruptcy typically is also weak.\n\n\nNatural resources or agricultural commodities make up an important share of exports for many developing countries.\n\n\nFor example, Russian petroleum, Malaysian timber, South African gold, and Colombian coffee.\n\n\nAttempts to circumvent government controls, taxes, and regulations have helped to make corrupt practices such as bribery and extortion a way of life in many developing countries.\n\n\nDue to government control of the economy and weak enforcement of economic laws and regulations, underground economies and corruption flourish.\n\n\n\n15.0.4 Developing-country borrowing and debt\nAnother common characteristic for many low- and middle-income countries is that they have traditionally borrowed from foreign countries.\n\nFinancial asset flows from foreign countries are able to finance investment projects, eventually leading to higher production and consumption.\nBut some investment projects fail and other borrowed funds are used primarily for consumption purposes.\nSome countries have defaulted on their foreign debts when the domestic economy stagnated or during financial crises.\nBut this trend has recently reversed as these countries have begun to save.\n\n\n\n15.0.5 The problem of default\n\nA financial crisis may involve\n\n\na debt crisis: an inability to repay sovereign (government) or private sector debt.\na balance of payments crisis.\na banking crisis: bankruptcy and other problems for private sector banks.\n\n\nA debt crisis in which governments default on their debt can be a self-fulfilling mechanism.\n\n\nFear of default reduces financial asset inflows and increases financial asset outflows (capital flight), decreasing investment and increasing interest rates, leading to low aggregate demand, output, and income.\nFinancial asset outflows must be matched with an increase in net exports or a decrease in official international reserves in order to pay individuals and institutions who desire foreign funds.\nOtherwise, the country cannot afford to pay those who want to remove their funds from the domestic economy.\nThe domestic government may have no choice but to default on its sovereign debt (paid for with foreign funds) when it comes due and when investors are unwilling to reinvest.\n\n\nIn general, a debt crisis can quickly magnify itself: it causes low income and high interest rates, which make government and private sector debts even harder to repay.\n\n\nHigh interest rates cause high interest payments for both the government and the private sector.\nLow income causes low tax revenue for the government.\nLow income makes loans made by private banks harder to repay: the default rate increases, which may cause bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n15.0.6 Alternative forms of financial inflow\n\nBond finance: government or private sector bonds are sold to foreign individuals and institutions.\nBank finance: commercial banks or securities firms lend to foreign governments or foreign businesses.\nOfficial lending: the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, or other official agencies lend to governments.\n\n\nSometimes these loans are made on a “concessional” or favorable basis, in which the interest rate is low.\n\n\nForeign direct investment: a firm directly acquires or expands operations in a subsidiary firm in a foreign country.\n\n\nA purchase by Ford of a subsidiary firm in Mexico is classified as foreign direct investment.\n\n\nPortfolio equity investment: a foreign investor purchases equity (stock) for his portfolio.\n\n\nPrivatization of government-owned firms in many countries has created more equity investment opportunities for foreign investors.\n\n\n\n15.0.7 The debt crisis of the 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, high interest rates and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused the burden of dollar-denominated debts in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile to increase drastically.\nA worldwide recession and a fall in many commodity prices also hurt export sectors in these countries.\nIn August 1982, Mexico announced that it could not repay its debts, mostly to private banks.\nThe U.S. government insisted that the private banks reschedule the debts, and in 1989\nMexico was able to achieve a reduction in the interest rate an extension of the repayment period a reduction in the principal by 12%\nBrazil, Argentina, and other countries were also allowed to reschedule their debts with private banks after they defaulted.\n\n\n\n15.0.8 East Asia: Success and crisis\n\nBefore the 1990s, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand relied mostly on domestic saving to finance investment.\nBut afterwards, foreign funds financed much of investment, and current account balances turned negative.\nDespite the rapid economic growth in East Asia between 1960 and 1997, growth was predicted to slow as economies “caught up” with Western countries.\n\n\n\n15.0.9 The Asian financial crises\n\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations and a lack of monitoring caused commercial firms, banks, and borrowers to engage in risky or even fraudulent activities: moral hazard.\nNonexistent or weakly enforced bankruptcy laws and loan contracts worsened problems after the crisis started.\nThe East Asian crisis started in Thailand in 1997, but quickly spread to other countries. Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines soon faced speculations about the value of their currencies.\nMost debts of banks and firms were denominated in U.S. dollars, so that devaluations of domestic currencies would make the burden of the debts in domestic currency increase.\nTo maintain fixed exchange rates would have required high interest rates and a reduction in government deficits, leading to a reduction in aggregate demand, output, and employment.\nAll of the affected economies except Malaysia turned to the IMF for loans to address the balance of payments crises and to maintain the value of the domestic currencies. Malaysia instead imposed controls on flows of financial assets so that it could increase its money supply (and lower interest rates), increase government purchases, and still try to maintain the value of the ringgit.\nBecause consumption and investment expenditure decreased with output, income, and employment, imports fell and the current account increased after 1997.\n\n\n\n15.0.10 Lessons of crises\n\nFixing the exchange rate has risks: governments desire to fix exchange rates to provide stability in the export and import sectors, but the price to pay may be high interest rates or high unemployment.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations can lead to risky investments and a banking crisis when a currency crisis erupts or when a fall in output, income, and employment occurs.\nLiberalizing financial asset flows without implementing sound financial regulations can lead to capital flight when investments lose value during a recession.\nThe importance of expectations: even healthy economies are vulnerable to crises when expectations change.\n\n\n\n15.0.11 Preventative (“prophylactic”) measures:\n\nBetter monitoring and more transparency: more information allows investors to make sound financial decisions in good and bad times.\nStronger enforcement of financial regulations: reduces moral hazard.\nDeposit insurance and reserve requirements.\nIncreased equity finance relative to debt finance.\nIncreased credit for troubled banks through central banks or the IMF?\n\n\n\n15.0.12 Summary\n\nSome countries have grown rapidly since 1960, but others have stagnated and remained poor.\nMany poor countries have extensive government control of the economy, unsustainable fiscal and monetary policies, lack of financial markets, weak enforcement of economic laws, a large amount of corruption, and low levels of education.\nMany developing economies have traditionally borrowed from international capital markets, and some have suffered from periodic sovereign debt crises, balance of payments crises, and banking crises.\nSovereign debt, balance of payments, and banking crises can be self-fulfilling, and each crisis can lead to another within a country or in another country.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations causes a moral hazard and may lead to a banking crisis, especially with free movement of financial assets.\nGeography and human capital may influence economic and political institutions, which in turn may affect long-term economic growth."

    "section": "8.1 Prospects of International Trade of Developing Countries",
    "text": "8.1 Prospects of International Trade of Developing Countries\n\nDeveloping countries have become major players in global trade. Their relative weight has grown enormously, mainly due to China’s meteoric rise as an exporter. Though they partly reflect surging oil prices, increasing exports from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Eastern Europe, and Central Asia have further increased the weight of developing countries in world trade.\nGDP projections suggest that the share of world trade held by developing countries will expand further, more than doubling over the next 40 years and reaching nearly 70 percent by 2050.\n\n\n8.1.1 Trade Liberalization since 1985\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, a number of developing countries moved to lower tariff rates and removed import quotas and other restrictions on trade. The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n\n\nFigure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries\n\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition. Figure 7a shows trends in tariff rates for an average of all developing countries and for two important developing countries, India and Brazil, which once relied heavily on import substitution as a development strategy. As you can see, there has been a dramatic fall in tariff rates in those two countries. Similar if less drastic changes in trade policy took place in many other developing countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 7b: The Growth of Developing-Country Trade\n\n\nTrade liberalization in developing countries had two clear effects. One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970. As you can see, the share of trade in GDP has tripled over that period, with most of the growth happening after 1985.\n\n\n8.1.2 Trade and Growth: Takeoff in Asia\n\n\n\nFigure 7c: The Asian Takeoff\n\n\nFigure 7c illustrates the Asian takeoff by showing the experiences of three countries: South Korea, the biggest of the original group of Asian “tigers”; China; and India. In each case, we show per-capita GDP as a percentage of the U.S. level, an indicator that highlights the extent of these nations’ economic “catchup.” As you can see, South Korea began its economic ascent in the 1960s, China at the end of the 1970s, and India circa 1990."

    "text": "10.1 In nearly every society, some kind of money has evolved to make trade easier.\n\nThe word “salary” comes from the wages paid to Roman soldiers, who were paid in sacks of sal—salt. Any medium of exchange—whether it is a gold coin, a whale tooth, or an American dollar—serves the same basic purposes.\nFirst, it serves as a means of exchange, so that I might enjoy pork chops for dinner tonight even though the butcher has no interest in buying this book.\nSecond, it serves as a unit of account, so that the cost of all kinds of goods and services can be measured and compared using one scale.\nThird, money must be portable and durable. Neither bowling balls nor rose petals would serve the purpose.\nLast, money must be relatively scarce so that it can serve as a store of value.\nClever people will always find a medium of exchange that works. Cigarettes long served as the medium of exchange in prisons, where cash is banned. It doesn’t matter whether you smoke; cigarettes have value as long as enough other inmates smoke.\nFor much of American history, commerce was conducted with paper currency backed by precious metals. Prior to the twentieth century, private banks issued their own money. In 1913, the U.S. government banned private money and became the sole provider of currency.\nThe basic idea did not change. Whether money was public or private, paper currency derived its value from the fact that it could be redeemed for a set quantity of gold or silver, either from a bank or from the government.\nThen something strange happened. In 1971, the United States permanently went off the gold standard. At that point, every paper dollar became redeemable for . . . nothing."

    "text": "16.2 Why that dollar in your pocket is more than just a piece of paper\n\nExamine that wad of USD 100 bills in your wallet. (If necessary, USD 1 bills can be substituted instead.) Those bills are just paper. You can’t eat them, you can’t drink them, you can’t smoke them, and, most important, you can’t take them to the government and demand anything in return. They have no intrinsic value. And that is true of nearly all the world’s currencies.\nLeft alone on a deserted island with $100 million, you would quickly perish. On the other hand, life would be good if you were rescued and could take the cash with you. Therein lies the value of modern currency: It has purchasing power.\nDollars have value because people peddling real things—food, books, pedicures—will accept them. And people peddling real things will accept dollars because they are confident that other people peddling other real things will accept them, too.\nA dollar is a piece of paper whose value derives solely from our confidence that we will be able to use it to buy something we need in the future."

    "text": "16.3 Modern money is a confidence game\n\nTo give you some sense of how modern money is a confidence game, consider a bizarre phenomenon in India.\nMost Indians involved in commerce—shopkeepers, taxi drivers, etc.—will not accept a torn, crumpled, or overly soiled rupee note. Since other Indians know that many of their countrymen will not accept torn notes, they will not accept them either.\nFinally, when tourists arrive in the country, they quickly learn to accept only intact bills, lest they be stuck with the torn ones.\nThe whole process is utterly irrational, since the Indian Central Bank considers any note with a serial number—torn, dirty, crumpled, or otherwise—to be legal tender. Any bank will exchange torn rupees for crisp new ones.\nThat doesn’t matter; rational people refuse legal tender because they believe that it might not be accepted by someone else. The whole bizarre phenomenon underscores the fact that our faith in paper currency is predicated on the faith that others place in the same paper."

    "section": "16.4 A case of USA",
    "text": "16.4 A case of USA\n\nSometimes simple statements speak loudly. On September 11, 2001, hours after the terrorist attacks on the United States, the Federal Reserve issued the following statement: “The Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window is available to meet liquidity needs.”\nHow exactly does an inelegant two-sentence statement have such a profound effect on the world’s largest economy—indeed, on the whole global economy?\nThe Federal Reserve has tools with more direct impact on the global economy than any other institution in the world, public or private.\nFrom where does the Federal Reserve, an institution that is not directly accountable to the voting public, derive such power? And how does that power affect the lives of everyday Americans?\nThe answer to all those questions is the same: The Federal Reserve controls the money supply and therefore the credit tap for the economy.\nWhen that tap is open wide, interest rates fall and we spend more freely on things that require borrowed money—everything from new cars to new manufacturing plants. Thus, the Fed can use monetary policy to counteract economic downturns (or prevent them in the first place). And it can inject money into the financial system after sudden shocks, such as the 1987 stock market crash or the terrorist attacks of September 11 or the bursting of the American real estate bubble, when consumers and firms might otherwise freeze in place and stop spending.\nOr the Fed can tighten the tap by raising interest rates. When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power.\n\n\n16.4.1 Some paradox\n\nIf the Fed can make the economy grow faster by lowering interest rates, then presumably lower interest rates are always better. Indeed, why should there be any limit to the rate at which the economy can grow?\nIf we begin to spend more freely when rates are cut from 7 percent to 5 percent, why stop there? If there are still people without jobs and others without new cars, then let’s press on to 3 percent, or even 1 percent. New money for everyone!\nSadly, there are limits to how fast any economy can grow. If low interest rates, or “easy money,” causes consumers to demand 5 percent more new Jeep Cherokees than they purchased last year, then Chrysler must expand production by 5 percent. That means hiring more workers and buying more steel, glass, electrical components, etc. At some point, it becomes difficult or impossible for Chrysler to find these new inputs, particularly qualified workers. At that point, the company simply cannot make enough Jeep Cherokees to satisfy consumer demand; instead, the company begins to raise prices. Meanwhile, autoworkers recognize that Chrysler is desperate for labor, and the union demands higher wages."

    "text": "16.5 Where does the Fed derive this extraordinary power over interest rates?\n\nAfter all, commercial banks are private entities. The Federal Reserve cannot force Citibank to raise or lower the rates it charges consumers for auto loans and home mortgages. Rather, the process is indirect.\nThe interest rate is really just a rental rate for capital, or the “price of money.” The Fed controls America’s money supply. For now, recognize that capital is no different from apartments: The greater the supply, the cheaper the rent.\nThe Fed moves interest rates by making changes in the quantity of funds available to commercial banks. If banks are awash with money, then interest rates must be relatively low to attract borrowers for all the available funds.\nWhen capital is scarce, the opposite will be true: Banks can charge higher interest rates and still attract enough borrowers for all available funds. It is supply and demand, with the Fed controlling the supply.\n\nReference: Wheelan, C (2002). Naked economics : Undressing the dismal science. New York : Norton"

    "text": "16.1 In nearly every society, some kind of money has evolved to make trade easier\n\nThe word “salary” comes from the wages paid to Roman soldiers, who were paid in sacks of sal—salt. Any medium of exchange—whether it is a gold coin, a whale tooth, or an American dollar—serves the same basic purposes.\nFirst, it serves as a means of exchange, so that I might enjoy pork chops for dinner tonight even though the butcher has no interest in buying this book.\nSecond, it serves as a unit of account, so that the cost of all kinds of goods and services can be measured and compared using one scale.\nThird, money must be portable and durable. Neither bowling balls nor rose petals would serve the purpose.\nLast, money must be relatively scarce so that it can serve as a store of value.\nClever people will always find a medium of exchange that works. Cigarettes long served as the medium of exchange in prisons, where cash is banned. It doesn’t matter whether you smoke; cigarettes have value as long as enough other inmates smoke.\nFor much of American history, commerce was conducted with paper currency backed by precious metals. Prior to the twentieth century, private banks issued their own money. In 1913, the U.S. government banned private money and became the sole provider of currency.\nThe basic idea did not change. Whether money was public or private, paper currency derived its value from the fact that it could be redeemed for a set quantity of gold or silver, either from a bank or from the government.\nThen something strange happened. In 1971, the United States permanently went off the gold standard. At that point, every paper dollar became redeemable for . . . nothing."

When a country imports more than it exports, it is buying more from foreigners than it sells to them and must somehow finance this current account deficit.\n\n\n11.1.1 How does country pay for additional imports once it has spent its export earnings?\n\nThe country as a whole can import more than it exports only if it can borrow the difference from foreigners.\nA country with a current account deficit must be increasing its net foreign debts by the amount of the deficit.\n\nExample: This is currently the position of the United States, which has a significant current account deficit.\n\nA country with a current account surplus is earning more from its exports than it spends on imports. This country finances the current account deficit of its trading partners by lending to them.\nWe have defined the current account as the difference between exports and import . The current account is also equal to the difference between national income and domestic residents’ total spending C + I + G:\n\n\\[CA = EX-IM\\] \\[Y - (C + I + G) = CA\\]"

    "section": "12.1 Money: A Brief Review",
    "text": "12.1 Money: A Brief Review\n\nWe are so accustomed to using money that we seldom notice the roles it plays in almost all of our everyday transactions. As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.\n\n\n12.1.1 Money as a Medium of Exchange\n\nThe most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade—the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services.\nMoney eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable.\nA complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Money as a Unit of Account\n\nMoney’s second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value.\nPrices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries’ money prices into comparable terms.\nThe convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities.\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Money as a Store of Value\n\nBecause money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.\nMoney’s usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets.vSince money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.\n\n\n\n12.1.4 How the Money Supply Is Determined\n\nAn economy’s money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks.\n\n\n\n12.1.5 Money Demand\n\nHow individual households and firms determine their demands for money? Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:\n\n\nThe interest rate: A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money.\nThe price level: The economy’s price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.\nReal national income: When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level."
