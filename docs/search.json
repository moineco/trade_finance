    "text": "Preface\nInternational Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and finance.\nThe aim of “International Trade and Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).",

This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\nBrain storming\n\nJapan is facing a continuous reduction of birth rate and increase in ageing population. This trend is adversely impacting on labor intensive sectors. For instance as healthcare and caregiver sector is suffering from the shortage of skilled labor in this sector. As a policy maker, what type of changes you will suggest.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 What is capital intensive industry?\n\nCapital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\nCapital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\nGood examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\nCapital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\nCapital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\nLabor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Open discussion\n\nInterpret the following figure based on your understanding of the content in lecture 2.\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Changing composition developing country exports\nReference: Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Economics, 12th edition)",

    "section": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith",
    "text": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage, developed by Adam Smith. He started with the simple truth that for two nations to trade with each other voluntarily, both nations must gain. If one nation gained nothing or lost, it would simply refuse to trade. But how does this mutually beneﬁcial trade take place, and from where do these gains from trade come?\nAccording to Adam Smith, trade between two nations is based on absolute advantage. When one nation is more efﬁcient than (or has an absolute advantage over) another in the production of one commodity but is less efﬁcient than (or has an absolute disadvantage with respect to) the other nation in producing a second commodity, then both nations can gain by each specializing in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of its output with the other nation for the commodity of its absolute disadvantage.\nBy this process, resources are utilized in the most efﬁcient way and the output of both commodities will rise. This increase in the output of both commodities measures the gains from specialization in production available to be divided between the two nations through trade.\nFor example, because of climatic conditions, Canada is efﬁcient in growing wheat but inefﬁcient in growing bananas (hothouses would have to be used). On the other hand, Nicaragua is efﬁcient in growing bananas but inefﬁcient in growing wheat. Thus, Canada has an absolute advantage over Nicaragua in the cultivation of wheat but an absolute dis- advantage in the cultivation of bananas. The opposite is true for Nicaragua.\nUnder these circumstances, both nations would beneﬁt if each specialized in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and then traded with the other nation. Canada would specialize in the production of wheat (i.e., produce more than needed domestically) and exchange some of it for (surplus) bananas grown in Nicaragua. As a result, both more wheat and more bananas would be grown and consumed, and both Canada and Nicaragua would gain.\nThus, while the mercantilism believed that one nation could gain only at the expense of another nation and advocated strict government control of all economic activity and trade, Adam Smith (and the other classical economists who followed him) believed that all nations would gain from free trade and strongly advocated a policy of laissez-faire (i.e., as little government interference with the economic system as possible).\nFree trade would cause world resources to be utilized most efﬁciently and would maximize world welfare. There were to be only a few exceptions to this policy of laissez-faire and free trade. One of these was the protection of industries important for national defense.\n\n\nIn view of this belief, it seems paradoxical that today most nations impose many restrictions on the free ﬂow of international trade.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example of absolute advantage:\n\none hour of labor time produces six kilograms of wheat in the United States but only one in the United Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, one hour of labor time produces ﬁve units of cloths in the United Kingdom but only four in the United States.\nThus, the United States is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United Kingdom in the production of wheat, whereas the United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United States in the production of cloth.\nWith trade, the United States would specialize in the production of wheat and exchange part of it for British cloth. The opposite is true for the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 3.1: Absolute advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage, however, can explain only a very small part of world trade today, such as some of the trade between developed and developing countries. Most of world trade, especially trade among developed countries, could not be explained by absolute advantage.",

The ﬁrst nation should specialize in the production and export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (this is the commodity of its comparative advantage) and import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is greater.\nThe statement of the law can be clariﬁed by looking at Table 3.2. The only difference between Tables 3.2 and 3.1 is that the United Kingdom now produces only two units of cloth per hour instead of ﬁve. Thus, the United Kingdom now has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both wheat and cloth with respect to the United States.\nHowever, since U.K. labor is half as productive in cloth but six times less productive in wheat with respect to the United States, the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in cloth.\nOn the other hand, the United States has an absolute advantage in both wheat and cloth with respect to the United Kingdom, but since its absolute advantage is greater in wheat (6:1) than in cloth (4:2), the United States has a comparative advantage in wheat.\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, both nations can gain if the United States specializes in the production of wheat and exports some of it in exchange for British cloth. At the same time, the United Kingdom is specializing in the production and exporting of cloth.\n\nTable 3.2: Comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n2",

But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish.

The following graph illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.\n\nProductive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in this graph, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\nAllocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nProductive and Allocative Efficiency",

    "section": "6.3 Political economy and trade policy",
    "text": "6.3 Political economy and trade policy\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand, Russia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only politically improper, as it serves only one country’s interest, but also economically counter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around €90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically, due to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere for sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies produce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to hoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions that go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n6.3.1 Free Trade and Efficiency\nThe efficiency case for free trade is simply the reverse of the cost-benefit analysis of a tariff. Figure 6a shows the basic point once again for the case of a small country that cannot influence foreign export prices. A tariff causes a net loss to the economy measured by the area of the two triangles; it does so by distorting the economic incentives of both producers and consumers. Conversely, a move to free trade eliminates these distortions and increases national welfare.\n\n\n\nFigure 6a: Efficiency of free trade\n\n\nIn the modern world, for reasons we will explain later in this chapter, tariff rates are generally low and import quotas relatively rare. As a result, estimates of the total costs of distortions due to tariffs and import quotas tend to be modest in size. Table 6a shows an estimate of the gains from a move to worldwide free trade, measured as a percentage of GDP. For the world as a whole, according to these estimates, protection costs less than 1 percent of GDP. The gains from free trade are somewhat smaller for advanced economies such as the United States and Europe and somewhat larger for poorer “developing countries.”\n\nTable 6.1: Benefits of Free Trade (Source: William Cline, Trade Policy and Global Poverty)\n\n\nCountry or region\nGrowth of GDP in percentage\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n0.57\n\n\nEuropean Union\n0.61\n\n\nJapan\n0.85\n\n\nDeveloping Countries\n1.4\n\n\nWorld\n0.93\n\n\n\nBecause tariff rates are already low for most of the countries, the estimated benefit to free trade is not significantly high for many nations and regions of the world.\n\nTable 6b: Effects of Alternative Trade Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\nTariff\nExport Subsidy\nImport Quota\nVoluntary Export Restraint\n\n\n\n\nProducer benefit\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\n\n\nConsumer benefit\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\n\n\nGovernment revenue\nIncreases\nFalls\nNo change\nNo change\n\n\nOverall national welfare\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\n\n\n\nAll four trade policies benefit producers and hurt consumers. The effects of the policies on economic welfare are at best ambiguous; two of the policies definitely hurt the nation as a whole, while tariffs and import quotas are potentially beneficial only for large countries that can drive down world prices.\n\n\n6.3.2 Which Industries Are Protected?\n\n6.3.2.1 Agriculture:\nIn the US, Europe and Japan farmers make up a small fraction of the electorate but receive generous subsidies and trade protection.\n\nEuropean Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)\nJapan’s 1000% tariff on imported rice\nAmerica’s sugar quota\n\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Manufacturing:\n\nCars in India and Indonesia, steel in the US\n\n\n\n6.3.2.3 Services:\n\nBanking in many countries, airlines almost everywhere\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Some other Instruments of Trade Policy\nTariffs are the simplest trade policies, but in the modern world, most government intervention in international trade takes other forms, such as:\n\nExport subsidies\nImport quotas\nVoluntary export restraints\nLocal content requirements\n\nFortunately, once we have understood tariffs, it is not too difficult to understand these other trade instruments.\n\n6.3.3.1 Export Subsidies\nAn export subsidy is a payment to a firm or individual that ships a good abroad. Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.\n\n\n6.3.3.2 Import Quotas\nAn import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm’s quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past.\n\n\n6.3.3.3 Voluntary Export Restraints\nA variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country’s side instead of the importer’s. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981.\n\n\n6.3.3.4 Local Content Requirements\nA local content requirement is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added. Local content laws have been widely used by developing countries trying to shift their manufacturing base from assembly back into intermediate goods.",

FTAs can help your company to enter and compete more easily in the global marketplace through zero or reduced tariffs and other provisions.

    "text": "7.5 The Infant Industry Argument\n\nAccording to the infant industry argument, developing countries have a potential comparative advantage in manufacturing, but new manufacturing industries in developing countries cannot initially compete with well-established manufacturing in developed countries.\nTo allow manufacturing to get a toehold, then, governments should temporarily support new industries until they have grown strong enough to meet international competition. Thus, it makes sense, according to this argument, to use tariffs or import quotas as temporary measures to get industrialization started.\n\n\n7.5.1 Problems with the Infant Industry Argument\nThe infant industry argument seems highly plausible, and in fact it has been persuasive to many governments. Yet economists have pointed out many pitfalls in the argument, suggesting that it must be used cautiously.\n\nFirst, it is not always a good idea to try to move today into the industries that will have a comparative advantage in the future. Suppose a country that is currently labor-abundant is in the process of accumulating capital. When it accumulates enough capital, it will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries. However, that does not mean it should try to develop these industries immediately.\nSecond, protecting manufacturing does no good unless the protection itself helps make industry competitive. For example, Pakistan and India have protected their manufacturing sectors for decades and have recently begun to develop significant exports of manufactured goods. The goods they export, however, are light manufactures like textiles, not the heavy manufactures that they protected; a good case can be made that they would have developed their manufactured exports even if they had never protected manufacturing.\nMore generally, the fact that it is costly and time-consuming to build up an industry is not an argument for government intervention unless there is some domestic market failure.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)",

    "text": "8.2 Case: India’s ecoonomic growth\nIndia, with a population of more than 1.1 billion people, is the world’s second-most-populous country. It’s also a growing force in world trade especially in new forms of trade that involve information rather than physical goods. The Indian city of Bangalore has become famous for its growing role in the global information technology industry.\nYet a generation ago, India was a very minor player in world trade. In part this was because the country’s economy performed poorly in general: Until about 1980, India eked out a rate of economic growth—sometimes mocked as the “Hindu rate of growth”—that was only about 1 percentage point higher than population growth. This slow growth was widely attributed to the stifling effect of bureaucratic restrictions. Observers spoke of a “license Raj”: Virtually any kind of business initiative required hard-to-get government permits, which placed a damper on investment and innovation. And India’s sluggish economy participated little in world trade.\nAfter the country achieved independence in 1948, its leaders adopted a particularly extreme form of import-substituting industrialization as the country’s development strategy: India imported almost nothing that it could produce domestically, even if the domestic product was far more expensive and of lower quality than what could be bought abroad. High costs, in turn, crimped exports. So India was a very “closed” economy. In the 1970s, imports and exports averaged only about 5 percent of GDP, close to the lowest levels of any major nation.\nThen everything changed. India’s growth accelerated dramatically: GDP per-capita, which had risen at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent from 1960 to 1980, has grown at close to 4 percent annually since 1980. And India’s participation in world trade surged as tariffs were brought down and import quotas were removed. In short, India has become a high-performance economy. It’s still a very poor country, but it is rapidly growing richer and has begun to rival China as a focus of world attention.\nThe big question, of course, is why India’s growth rate has increased so dramatically. That question is the subject of heated debate among economists. Some have argued that trade liberalization, which allowed India to participate in the global economy, was crucial. Others point out that India’s growth began accelerating around 1980, whereas the big changes in trade policy didn’t occur until the beginning of the 1990s.\nWhatever caused the change, India’s transition has been a welcome development. More than a billion people now have much greater hope for a decent standard of living.\n\n8.2.1 The Rising Weight of Developing Countries in World Trade\n\nDeveloping countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\nThe share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise—its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n\nTrade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 The Rise of South-South Trade\n\nOver the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly—though not exclusively—involving Asian nations.\nChina and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing $32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just $545 million in 1996.\nBilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from $686 million to $14.5 billion.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)",

In turn, these concerns are playing a growing role in domestic politics. environmental issues are playing a growing role in disputes about international trade as well. Some anti-globalization activists claim that growing international trade automatically harms the environment; some also claim that international trade agreements—and the role of the World Trade Organization in particular—have the effect of blocking environmental action.\nMost international economists view the first claim as simplistic and disagree with the second. That is, they deny that there is a simple relationship between globalization and environmental damage and do not believe that trade agreements prevent countries from having enlightened environmental policies. Nonetheless, the intersection of trade and the environment does raise a number of important issues.",

    "text": "Empirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage–but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9a: Environmental Kuznet Curve\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive “inverted U” relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\nThe idea is that as a country’s income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\nBut when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.\n\n\n\nFigure 9b: Different stages in EKC\n\n\n\n\n9.1.1 The N-shaped EKC\n\nScholars supporting N-shaped EKC have proposed a different theory. They believed that even at a higher stage of economic development if innovation cannot keep up with the speed of economic growth and the increase in technological effects is slower than the scale effect, environmental pollution may reappear (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016).\nIn other words, the shape of the EKC may extend from an inverted U-shape to an N-shape. This N-shaped model assumes that economic growth leads to environmental degradation that reverses with economic progress after reaching a positive peak and that pollution levels approach a negative peak before starting to rise again with further economic progress.\nCompared with the inverted U-shaped EKC, the most critical gap lies in the rebound of environmental pollution in the third stage. Scholars refer to this pattern as the technological obsolescence effect, representing the re-emergence of scale effects and overcoming the compositional and technological effects that preceded the second turning point (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016; Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018).\nThe emergence of this phenomenon is believed to be related to neglected environmental regulations and slow technological innovation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: N-shaped EKC",

    "text": "9.2 What does Kuznet Curve have to do with international trade?\n\nTrade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve—that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\nHowever, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it’s fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment—at least so far.\nThis argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.\nChina’s boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It’s important to realize, though, that the problem here isn’t globalization per se—it’s China’s economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it’s difficult to argue that China’s growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9c: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)",

    "text": "9.3 The Problem of “Pollution Havens”\nWhen ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their scrap metal and other materials. One way to look at “shipbreaking” is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a shipbreaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect shipbreaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals impose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\nThus, to the extent that Indian shipbreaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation.",

    "text": "9.4 The Carbon Tariff Dispute\nIn 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases—that is, a system under which a limited number of emissions licenses are issued and firms are required to buy enough licenses to cover their actual emissions, in effect putting a price on carbon dioxide and other gases. The Senate failed to pass any comparable bill, so climate-change legislation is on hold for the time being. Nonetheless, there was a key trade provision in the House bill that may represent the shape of things to come: It imposed carbon tariffs on imports from countries that fail to enact similar policies.\nThe idea behind carbon tariffs is to charge importers of goods from countries without climate-change policies an amount proportional to the carbon dioxide emitted in the production of those goods. The charge per ton of emissions would be equal to the price of carbon dioxide emission licenses in the domestic market. This would give overseas producers an incentive to limit their carbon emissions and would remove the incentive to shift production to countries with lax regulation. In addition, it would, possibly, give countries with lax regulations an incentive to adopt climate-change policies of their own.\nAt this point, the issue of carbon tariffs is hypothetical, since no major economy has yet placed a significant price on greenhouse gas emissions. Correspondingly, the WTO hasn’t issued any rulings on the legality of such tariffs, and probably won’t until or unless a real case emerges. But if climate-change legislation makes a comeback—and it is a good bet that it will sooner or later—it will clearly lead to some major new issues in trade policy.",

The branch of economics called microeconomics studies this problem from the perspective of individual firms and consumers. Microeconomics works “from the bottom up” to show how individual economic actors, by pursuing their own interests, collectively determine how resources are used. In our study of international microeconomics, we have learned how individual production and consumption decisions produce patterns of international trade and specialization. We have also seen that while free trade usually encourages efficient resource use, government intervention or market failailures can cause waste even when all factors of production are fully employed.\nWe shift our focus and ask: How can economic policy ensure that factors of production are fully employed? And what determines how an economy’s capacity to produce goods and services changes over time? To answer these questions, we must understand macroeconomics, the branch of economics that studies how economies’ overall levels of employment, production, and growth are determined. Like microeconomics, macroeconomics is concerned with the effective use of scarce resources. But while microeconomics focuses on the economic decisions of individuals, macroeconomics analyzes the behavior of an economy as a whole. In our study of international macroeconomics, we will learn how the interactions of national economies influence the worldwide pattern of macroeconomic activity.\nMacroeconomic analysis emphasizes four aspects of economic life that, until now, we have usually kept in the background to simplify our discussion of international economics:\nTo get a complete picture of the macroeconomic linkages among economies that engage in international trade, we have to master two related and essential tools.",

All else equal, a depreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods cheaper for foreigners. All else equal, an appreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods more expensive for foreigners.\n\n12.2.1 The Foreign Exchange Market\nThe market in which international currency trades take place is called the foreign exchange market.\n\n12.2.1.1 The Actors\nThe major participants in the foreign exchange market are commercial banks, corporations that engage in international trade, non-bank financial institutions such as asset management firms and insurance companies, and central banks.\nI now describe the major actors in the market and their roles.\n\nCommercial banks: Commercial banks are at the center of the foreign exchange market because almost every sizable international transaction involves the debiting and crediting of accounts at commercial banks in various financial centers. Thus, the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions involve the exchange of bank deposits denominated in different currencies.\nCorporations: Corporations with operations in several countries frequently make or receive payments in currencies other than that of the country in which they are headquartered. To pay workers at a plant in Mexico, for example, IBM may need Mexican pesos. If IBM has only dollars earned by selling computers in the United States, it can acquire the pesos it needs by buying them with its dollars in the foreign exchange market.\nNon-bank financial institutions: Over the years, deregulation of financial markets in the United States, Japan, and other countries has encouraged non-bank financial institutions such as mutual funds to offer their customers a broader range of services, many of them indistinguishable from those offered by banks. Among these have been services involving foreign exchange transactions. Institutional investors such as pension funds often trade foreign currencies. So do insurance companies. Hedge funds, which cater to very wealthy individuals and are not bound by the government regulations that limit mutual funds’ trading strategies, trade actively in the foreign exchange market.\nCentral banks: In the last chapter, we learned that central banks sometimes intervene in foreign exchange markets. While the volume of central bank transactions is typically not large, the impact of these transactions may be great. The reason for this impact is that participants in the foreign exchange market watch central bank actions closely for clues about future macroeconomic policies that may affect exchange rates. Government agencies other than central banks may also trade in the foreign exchange market, but central banks are the most regular official participants.",

    "text": "Do you think that geography is important in influencing economic and political institutions, and ultimately poverty?\n\n13.0.1 Geography matters\nInternational trade is important for growth, and ocean harbors and a lack of geographical barriers foster trade with foreign markets.\n\nLandlocked and mountainous regions are predicted to be poor.\nAlso, geography is said to have determined institutions, which may play a role in development.\nGeography determined whether Westerners established property rights and long-term investment in colonies, which in turn influenced economic growth.\nGeography determined whether Westerners died from malaria and other diseases. With high mortality rates, they established practices and institutions based on quick plunder of colonies’ resources, rather than institutions favoring long-term economic growth.\nPlunder led to property confiscation and corruption, even after political independence from Westerners.\nGeography also determined whether local economies were better for plantation agriculture, which resulted in income inequalities and political inequalities. Under this system, equal property rights were not established, hindering long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\n13.0.2 The gravity model\n\nLet’s begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today’s global economy.\nThree of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.\n\n\nThere is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country’s economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports.\n\n\nThe basic form of the gravity equation is as follows:\n\n\\[T_{ij} = \\frac{GDP_{i}^{\\alpha } GDP_{j}^{\\beta}}{D_{ij}^{\\theta}}\\] Here,\n\\(T_{ij}\\) indicates bilateral trade between country \\(i\\), and \\(j\\)\n\\(GDP_i\\) indicates the economic size of \\(i\\), measured by gross domestic product\n\\(D_{ij}\\) indicates the bilateral distance between the two countries\nThe parameters are \\(α\\), \\(β\\), and \\(θ\\)\n\n\n13.0.3 Geography and transportation\nGeography and economy are closely tied together because transport makes trade with widespread areas possible. This is because geographical features include mountains, deserts, and water, which directly impact the movement of people and thus the movement of trade. The integration of the world economy has increased rapidly in recent decades, with world trade growing more than twice as fast as world GDP since 1980. The two main reasons behind it are\n\nTrade liberalization\nDecline in trade costs (including transport and communication costs)\n\n\n\n13.0.4 Globalization and international trade\nIn a global economy, no nation is self-sufficient, which is associated with specific flows of goods, people, and information. International trade, or long-distance trade, has taken place for centuries, with some ancient trade routes predating history. Trade is an important part of economic and cultural history, as ancient trade routes such as the Silk Road can testify.\n\n\n13.0.5 The Silk Road\nThe Silk Road was the most enduring trade route in human history, being used for about 1,500 years. Its name is taken from the prized Chinese textile that flowed from Asia to the Middle East and Europe, although many other commodities were traded along the route. The Silk Road consisted of a succession of trails followed by caravans through Central Asia, about 6,400 km in length.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, trade was taking an increasingly active role in the economic life of nations and regions, and after the mid-20th century, trade became an active tool of economic globalization.\n\nThe Silk Road was a vast trade network connecting Eurasia and North Africa via land and sea routes.\nThe Silk Road earned its name from Chinese silk, a highly valued commodity that merchants transported along these trade networks.\nAdvances in technology and increased political stability caused an increase in trade. The opening of more trade routes caused travelers to exchange many things: animals, spices, ideas, and diseases.\n\n\n\n13.0.5.1 Travel on the Silk Road\n\nTraders had to find ways to move their goods efficiently. To travel overland, the camel was favored mode of transportation.\nNomadic peoples in central Asia started domesticating camels as early as the second millennium BCE. For example, the Han Chinese used camels captured from the Xiongnu to carry military supplies.\nCamels could withstand the harsh desert conditions through central Asia and were also able to carry up to 500 pounds at a time! Pack animals—especially camels—made the transportation of goods over land on the Silk Road viable.\n\n\n\n13.0.5.2 The effects of exchange\nOne obvious effect of trade along the Silk Road was more goods were available in more places. Silk, owing to its soft texture and appealing shimmer, became so hotly desired that it was used as currency in central Asia. However, the process of raising silkworms and creating fabric from their cocoons remained a Chinese secret through the 6th century C.E. The fact that China remained the only source of silk meant that trade goods continued to travel across Asia. This involved many people and locations in the Silk Road trade networks.\n\n\n13.0.5.3 Chinese silk in Rome\nSo now we have a sense of the economic and political conditions that enabled Chinese silk to make its way to Roman markets. Both the Han Chinese and Roman Empires controlled vast territories and kept them relatively peaceful. The Han conquered their way into central Asia. From there, nomadic traders carried goods farther west or south. Trade brought new faiths, new ideas, and new goods to places they had not previously been.\n\n\n\n13.0.6 Living in cities\nRoughly two thirds of the world’s population is projected to live in cities by the year 2050, with the urban population increasing by around 2.5 billion people, and nearly 90 percent of this increase concentrated in Asia and Africa.\nHow do people and economic activities sort across geographic space in response?\n\n\n13.0.7 The China shock\nWith its rapid economic growth following its market-orientated reforms of 1978, China has emerged as a major source of import competition for producers of manufactured goods in developed countries such as the United States.\nIn 1991, low-income countries accounted for just 9 percent of U.S. manufacturing imports. In contrast, by 2000, the low-income country share of U.S. imports reached 15 percent and climbed to 28 percent by 2007, with China accounting for 89 percent of this growth.\nThis rise in import penetration is particularly rapid following China’s admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and coincides with a marked decline in U.S. manufacturing\n\n\n13.0.8 The Earth at night light: Proxy of economic growth\n\n\n\nEarth night light in 2012\n\n\n\n\n13.0.9 Human capital matters\n\nAs a population becomes more literate, numerate, and educated, economic and political institutions evolve to foster long-term economic growth.\nRather than geography, Western colonization, and plantation agriculture, the amount of education and other forms of human capital determine the existence or lack of property rights, financial markets, international trade, and other institutions that encourage economic growth.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Colonial powers\n\n\n\n\n13.0.10 Water transportation\n\n\n\nFigure: Geographical Impacts of the Suez and Panama canals\n\n\n\n\n13.0.11 Population growth\nPopulation distribution become high due to the following factors:\n\nType of Land: Flat low land (Ganges Valley in India)\nResources: Resource rich areas (e.g. coal, oil, wood, fishing etc.) tend to densely populated (Western Europe)\nClimate: Areas with temperate climates tend to be densely populated (rain and temperature) (Belgium)\nPolitical: Politically stable countries tend to have high populations\nSocial: Groups of people want to live close to each other for security (e.g. USA). Other groups of people prefer to be isolated (e.g. Scandinavians)\nEconomic: Job opportunities encourage high population densities, particularly in large cities\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Population distribution by latitude\n\n\n\n\n13.0.12 Migration from developing countries to developed countries\n\n\n\nFigure: Global net migration (2010-2015)\n\n\n\n\n13.0.13 Weather and climate\n\n\n\nFigure: Sum of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation [kWh/m2]",

    "text": "14.0.1 The gap between rich and poor\nWorld Bank classify the countries into four categories according to their level of income.\n\n\n\nTable: New World Bank country classifications by income level: 2022-2023\n\n\nThe World Bank assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income. The classifications are updated each year on July 1 and are based on the GNI per capita of the previous year (2021). GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nLow income: most sub-Saharan Africa, India, Pakistan\nLower-middle income: China, Caribbean countries\nUpper-middle income: Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Africa, Czech Republic\nHigh income: U.S., Singapore, France, Japan, Kuwait\n\n\n\n14.0.2 Has the world income gap narrowed over time?\nWhile some previously middle- and low-income economies have grown faster than high-income countries, and thus have “caught up” with high- income countries, others have languished. The income levels of high-income countries and some previously middle-income and low-income countries have converged. But the some of the poorest countries have had the lowest growth rates.\n\n14.0.2.1 Inequality within countries: Gini index\nThe Gini index is a measure of how equal a country’s distribution of income is. It is a score between 0 and 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. Perfect equality means a country’s total income is shared equally among its residents, whereas perfect inequality means a country’s total income is owned by a single individual.\nFor example, you can see that South Africa is (by this measure) the most unequal country in the world with a Gini index of 0.63\n\n\n14.0.2.2 Inequality between countries\nOver the last two decades global inequalities between countries have declined, income inequality has increased within most countries. Inequality varies significantly between the most equal region (Europe) and the most unequal (Middle East and North Africa i.e. “MENA”). In Europe, the top 10% income share is around 36%, whereas in “MENA” it reaches 58%. In between these two levels, we see a diversity of patterns. In East Asia, the top 10% makes 43% of total income and in Latin America, 55%.\n\n\n\nFigure: Income inequality levels across the regions\n\n\n\n\n14.0.2.3 How bad is extreme poverty globally?\nIt is true that ~700 million people around the world live on less than $1.90 USD per day. This forces people to make impossible choices for themselves and their families regarding healthcare, food, water, education, and housing. As a result, ~14,500 children under the age of five die every day from completely preventable causes, such as malaria, diarrhea, or malnutrition.\n\n\n14.0.2.4 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on income inequality\n2020 marked the steepest increase in the global billionaires’ share of wealth on record, the report found. Indeed, since 1995, the share of global wealth owned by billionaires’ has risen from 1% to over 3%.\n\n\n\n14.0.3 Structural features of developing countries\nWhat causes poverty is a difficult question, but low-income countries have at least some of following characteristics, which could contribute to poverty:\n\nGovernment control of the economy\n\n\nRestrictions on trade\nDirect control of production in industries and a high level of government purchases relative to GNP\nDirect control of financial transactions\nReduced competition reduces innovation; lack of market prices prevents efficient allocation of resources\n\n\nUnsustainable macroeconomic policies that cause high inflation and unstable output and employment\n\n\nIf governments cannot pay for debts through taxes, they can print money to finance debts.\nSeigniorage is paying for real goods and services by printing money.\nSeigniorage generally leads to high inflation.\nHigh inflation reduces the real cost of debt that the government has to repay and reduces the real value of repayments for lenders.\nHigh and variable inflation is costly to society; unstable output and employment is also costly.\n\n\nLack of financial markets that allow transfer of funds from savers to borrowers\n\n\nBanks frequently lend funds to poor or risky projects.\nLoans may be made on the basis of personal connections rather than prospective returns, and government safeguards against financial fragility, such as bank supervision, tend to be ineffective due to incompetence, inexperience, and outright fraud.\nUsually harder in developing countries for shareholders to find out how a firm’s money is being spent or to control firm managers.\nThe legal framework for resolving asset ownership in cases of bankruptcy typically is also weak.\n\n\nNatural resources or agricultural commodities make up an important share of exports for many developing countries.\n\n\nFor example, Russian petroleum, Malaysian timber, South African gold, and Colombian coffee.\n\n\nAttempts to circumvent government controls, taxes, and regulations have helped to make corrupt practices such as bribery and extortion a way of life in many developing countries.\n\n\nDue to government control of the economy and weak enforcement of economic laws and regulations, underground economies and corruption flourish.\n\n\n\n14.0.4 Developing-country borrowing and debt\nAnother common characteristic for many low- and middle-income countries is that they have traditionally borrowed from foreign countries.\n\nFinancial asset flows from foreign countries are able to finance investment projects, eventually leading to higher production and consumption.\nBut some investment projects fail and other borrowed funds are used primarily for consumption purposes.\nSome countries have defaulted on their foreign debts when the domestic economy stagnated or during financial crises.\nBut this trend has recently reversed as these countries have begun to save.\n\n\n\n14.0.5 The problem of default\n\nA financial crisis may involve\n\n\na debt crisis: an inability to repay sovereign (government) or private sector debt.\na balance of payments crisis.\na banking crisis: bankruptcy and other problems for private sector banks.\n\n\nA debt crisis in which governments default on their debt can be a self-fulfilling mechanism.\n\n\nFear of default reduces financial asset inflows and increases financial asset outflows (capital flight), decreasing investment and increasing interest rates, leading to low aggregate demand, output, and income.\nFinancial asset outflows must be matched with an increase in net exports or a decrease in official international reserves in order to pay individuals and institutions who desire foreign funds.\nOtherwise, the country cannot afford to pay those who want to remove their funds from the domestic economy.\nThe domestic government may have no choice but to default on its sovereign debt (paid for with foreign funds) when it comes due and when investors are unwilling to reinvest.\n\n\nIn general, a debt crisis can quickly magnify itself: it causes low income and high interest rates, which make government and private sector debts even harder to repay.\n\n\nHigh interest rates cause high interest payments for both the government and the private sector.\nLow income causes low tax revenue for the government.\nLow income makes loans made by private banks harder to repay: the default rate increases, which may cause bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n14.0.6 Alternative forms of financial inflow\n\nBond finance: government or private sector bonds are sold to foreign individuals and institutions.\nBank finance: commercial banks or securities firms lend to foreign governments or foreign businesses.\nOfficial lending: the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, or other official agencies lend to governments.\n\n\nSometimes these loans are made on a “concessional” or favorable basis, in which the interest rate is low.\n\n\nForeign direct investment: a firm directly acquires or expands operations in a subsidiary firm in a foreign country.\n\n\nA purchase by Ford of a subsidiary firm in Mexico is classified as foreign direct investment.\n\n\nPortfolio equity investment: a foreign investor purchases equity (stock) for his portfolio.\n\n\nPrivatization of government-owned firms in many countries has created more equity investment opportunities for foreign investors.\n\n\n\n14.0.7 The debt crisis of the 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, high interest rates and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused the burden of dollar-denominated debts in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile to increase drastically.\nA worldwide recession and a fall in many commodity prices also hurt export sectors in these countries.\nIn August 1982, Mexico announced that it could not repay its debts, mostly to private banks.\nThe U.S. government insisted that the private banks reschedule the debts, and in 1989\nMexico was able to achieve a reduction in the interest rate an extension of the repayment period a reduction in the principal by 12%\nBrazil, Argentina, and other countries were also allowed to reschedule their debts with private banks after they defaulted.\n\n\n\n14.0.8 East Asia: Success and crisis\n\nBefore the 1990s, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand relied mostly on domestic saving to finance investment.\nBut afterwards, foreign funds financed much of investment, and current account balances turned negative.\nDespite the rapid economic growth in East Asia between 1960 and 1997, growth was predicted to slow as economies “caught up” with Western countries.\n\n\n\n14.0.9 The Asian financial crises\n\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations and a lack of monitoring caused commercial firms, banks, and borrowers to engage in risky or even fraudulent activities: moral hazard.\nNonexistent or weakly enforced bankruptcy laws and loan contracts worsened problems after the crisis started.\nThe East Asian crisis started in Thailand in 1997, but quickly spread to other countries. Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines soon faced speculations about the value of their currencies.\nMost debts of banks and firms were denominated in U.S. dollars, so that devaluations of domestic currencies would make the burden of the debts in domestic currency increase.\nTo maintain fixed exchange rates would have required high interest rates and a reduction in government deficits, leading to a reduction in aggregate demand, output, and employment.\nAll of the affected economies except Malaysia turned to the IMF for loans to address the balance of payments crises and to maintain the value of the domestic currencies. Malaysia instead imposed controls on flows of financial assets so that it could increase its money supply (and lower interest rates), increase government purchases, and still try to maintain the value of the ringgit.\nBecause consumption and investment expenditure decreased with output, income, and employment, imports fell and the current account increased after 1997.\n\n\n\n14.0.10 Lessons of crises\n\nFixing the exchange rate has risks: governments desire to fix exchange rates to provide stability in the export and import sectors, but the price to pay may be high interest rates or high unemployment.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations can lead to risky investments and a banking crisis when a currency crisis erupts or when a fall in output, income, and employment occurs.\nLiberalizing financial asset flows without implementing sound financial regulations can lead to capital flight when investments lose value during a recession.\nThe importance of expectations: even healthy economies are vulnerable to crises when expectations change.\n\n\n\n14.0.11 Preventative (“prophylactic”) measures:\n\nBetter monitoring and more transparency: more information allows investors to make sound financial decisions in good and bad times.\nStronger enforcement of financial regulations: reduces moral hazard.\nDeposit insurance and reserve requirements.\nIncreased equity finance relative to debt finance.\nIncreased credit for troubled banks through central banks or the IMF?\n\n\n\n14.0.12 Summary\n\nSome countries have grown rapidly since 1960, but others have stagnated and remained poor.\nMany poor countries have extensive government control of the economy, unsustainable fiscal and monetary policies, lack of financial markets, weak enforcement of economic laws, a large amount of corruption, and low levels of education.\nMany developing economies have traditionally borrowed from international capital markets, and some have suffered from periodic sovereign debt crises, balance of payments crises, and banking crises.\nSovereign debt, balance of payments, and banking crises can be self-fulfilling, and each crisis can lead to another within a country or in another country.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations causes a moral hazard and may lead to a banking crisis, especially with free movement of financial assets.\nGeography and human capital may influence economic and political institutions, which in turn may affect long-term economic growth.",

    "text": "We are all asset managers. Whether as farmers or fishermen, hunters or gatherers, foresters or miners, households or companies, governments or communities, we manage the assets we have access to in line with our motivations, as best as we can.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity\n\n\nThe biosphere, which is the part of Earth that is occupied by living organisms, is a selforganising, regenerative entity. Its rhythms, for example the seasons, shape the regeneration patterns of the living world. Biological diversity, or biodiversity for short, means the diversity of life. Biodiversity is a characteristic of ecosystems. It enables ecosystems to flourish and supply the wide variety of services we have just alluded to.\nMany studies have linked export-intensive industries with biodiversity threats, for example:\n\nCoffee growing in Mexico (1) and Latin America (2)\nSoya (3) and beef (4) production in Brazil\nForestry (5) and fishing (6) in Papua New Guinea\nPalm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia (7)\nOrnamental fish catching in Vietnam (8)\n\nFreer trade is well known to generate economic benefits, in particular through specialization according to comparative advantages. However, international trade is linked to biodiversity losses through direct impact of transport and the induced pollution and introduction of pathogens and invasive species. It is also linked more indirectly to global biodiversity losses through habitat changes, over-exploitation and other forms of pollution. Trade impacts on global biodiversity, for instance through the ‘virtual’ water, land, and deforestation contained in imports.\n\n15.0.1 Trade plays a role in the “Uniformisation” of cultivated species.\n\nInternational trade participates in the dissemination of innovation, since most productive varieties tend to be used more widely, with an increase in economic competition under freer trade. Trade in honey bees, for example, has led to the introduction of more productive and docile queen bees (e.g. a species from Hawaii in particular) all over the world and has reduced genetic diversity, which could be one of the many explanations for the colony collapse disorder.\nSecond, trade induces specialization, leading countries to concentrate their agricultural production on a few species (and within species, on a few varieties) with high yields, according to their comparative advantages. This mechanism results in the uniformisation of agricultural landscapes.\n\n\n\n15.0.2 Trade plays a role in the “Transport” rise dramatically\n\nTransport of goods and people have risen dramatically over the last decades, along with transport infrastructures. This has resulted in a dramatic surge in related pollution and habitat perturbations, with negative consequences on biodiversity.\nInternational maritime trade has increased from less than 4 billion tonnes in 1980 to almost 12 billion tonnes in 2018. Many of the 80000 cargo ships use highly polluting fuel, and emit various pollutants along with \\(CO_2\\) including black carbon, sulphur dioxide (\\(S0_2\\)), nitrogen oxides (\\(NO_x\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). In addition, port development has often been detrimental to seashore ecosystems, including mudflats, mangroves and fish natural hatcheries.\nAll the emissions caused by transport have a significant effect on biodiversity. \\(SO_2\\) results in acid rain which has caused collapse of trees in large forest areas. The impact of \\(NO_x\\) and ozone on aquatic insects that are the basis of the food chain, and on vegetation is considerable: ozone pollution have been measured as reducing wheat and forest yields by amounts that reach 60%.\n\n\n\n15.0.3 Global Population\nGlobal population grew sharply in the years following the mid-20th century, because the substantial reductions in death rates traceable to advances in medicine and public health practices were not matched by reductions in fertility rates. The global ecological footprint depends on the absolute population size. A population can be stable, but if large it would have a big footprint, other things equal, and could bring the biosphere into disrepair. That is why the replacement fertility rate is not as significant a notion of ‘fertility transition’ (the transition from high fertility rates to the replacement rate) in the economics of biodiversity as it is in demography.\n\n\n\nTotal Population Size by Region, Estimates and Projections, 1950 to 2100\n\n\n\n\n15.0.4 Trade and biodiversity\nTrade occurs across a wide range of spatial scales, with international, regional, and domestic exchange of goods all potentially leading to impacts on biodiversity. In the case of international trade, demand for products from outside a country’s borders contributes substantially to local environmental impacts in the products’ country of origin. Much of the international trade-related pressure on biodiversity occurs in developing countries, which have high agricultural land-use potential and typically high biodiversity. This pressure is often a result of demand from developed countries for imported products such as bananas, beef, cane sugar, chocolate, coconut, coffee, palm oil, soybeans, and tea, to name a few, which are all produced in previously forested areas.\n\n\n\nTrade and Biodiversity (Ortiz, Andrea Monica D., et al.)\n\n\nTrade also affects biodiversity through the introduction of invasive species. Invasive species aggressively invade new continents so that these species become dominant in their new geographical areas. The increase in global transport networks and the increasing demand for externally sourced products has contributed to the increased risk of biological invasions.\nRef:\n\nPerfecto, I., Mas, A., Dietsch, T. & Vandermeer, J.

Though they partly reflect surging oil prices, increasing exports from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Eastern Europe, and Central Asia have further increased the weight of developing countries in world trade.\nGDP projections suggest that the share of world trade held by developing countries will expand further, more than doubling over the next 40 years and reaching nearly 70 percent by 2050.\n\n\n8.1.1 Trade Liberalization since 1985\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, a number of developing countries moved to lower tariff rates and removed import quotas and other restrictions on trade. The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n\n\nFigure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries\n\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition. Figure 7a shows trends in tariff rates for an average of all developing countries and for two important developing countries, India and Brazil, which once relied heavily on import substitution as a development strategy. As you can see, there has been a dramatic fall in tariff rates in those two countries. Similar if less drastic changes in trade policy took place in many other developing countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 7b: The Growth of Developing-Country Trade\n\n\nTrade liberalization in developing countries had two clear effects. One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970. As you can see, the share of trade in GDP has tripled over that period, with most of the growth happening after 1985.\n\n\n8.1.2 Trade and Growth: Takeoff in Asia\n\n\n\nFigure 7c: The Asian Takeoff\n\n\nFigure 7c illustrates the Asian takeoff by showing the experiences of three countries: South Korea, the biggest of the original group of Asian “tigers”; China; and India. In each case, we show per-capita GDP as a percentage of the U.S. level, an indicator that highlights the extent of these nations’ economic “catchup.” As you can see, South Korea began its economic ascent in the 1960s, China at the end of the 1970s, and India circa 1990.",

Since other Indians know that many of their countrymen will not accept torn notes, they will not accept them either.\nFinally, when tourists arrive in the country, they quickly learn to accept only intact bills, lest they be stuck with the torn ones.\nThe whole process is utterly irrational, since the Indian Central Bank considers any note with a serial number—torn, dirty, crumpled, or otherwise—to be legal tender. Any bank will exchange torn rupees for crisp new ones.\nThat doesn’t matter; rational people refuse legal tender because they believe that it might not be accepted by someone else. The whole bizarre phenomenon underscores the fact that our faith in paper currency is predicated on the faith that others place in the same paper."

    "text": "16.4 A case of USA\n\nSometimes simple statements speak loudly. On September 11, 2001, hours after the terrorist attacks on the United States, the Federal Reserve issued the following statement: “The Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window is available to meet liquidity needs.”\nHow exactly does an inelegant two-sentence statement have such a profound effect on the world’s largest economy—indeed, on the whole global economy?\nThe Federal Reserve has tools with more direct impact on the global economy than any other institution in the world, public or private.\nFrom where does the Federal Reserve, an institution that is not directly accountable to the voting public, derive such power? And how does that power affect the lives of everyday Americans?\nThe answer to all those questions is the same: The Federal Reserve controls the money supply and therefore the credit tap for the economy.\nWhen that tap is open wide, interest rates fall and we spend more freely on things that require borrowed money—everything from new cars to new manufacturing plants. Thus, the Fed can use monetary policy to counteract economic downturns (or prevent them in the first place). And it can inject money into the financial system after sudden shocks, such as the 1987 stock market crash or the terrorist attacks of September 11 or the bursting of the American real estate bubble, when consumers and firms might otherwise freeze in place and stop spending.\nOr the Fed can tighten the tap by raising interest rates. When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power.\n\n\n16.4.1 Some paradox\n\nIf the Fed can make the economy grow faster by lowering interest rates, then presumably lower interest rates are always better. Indeed, why should there be any limit to the rate at which the economy can grow?\nIf we begin to spend more freely when rates are cut from 7 percent to 5 percent, why stop there? If there are still people without jobs and others without new cars, then let’s press on to 3 percent, or even 1 percent. New money for everyone!\nSadly, there are limits to how fast any economy can grow. If low interest rates, or “easy money,” causes consumers to demand 5 percent more new Jeep Cherokees than they purchased last year, then Chrysler must expand production by 5 percent. That means hiring more workers and buying more steel, glass, electrical components, etc. At some point, it becomes difficult or impossible for Chrysler to find these new inputs, particularly qualified workers. At that point, the company simply cannot make enough Jeep Cherokees to satisfy consumer demand; instead, the company begins to raise prices. Meanwhile, autoworkers recognize that Chrysler is desperate for labor, and the union demands higher wages."

The Federal Reserve cannot force Citibank to raise or lower the rates it charges consumers for auto loans and home mortgages. Rather, the process is indirect.\nThe interest rate is really just a rental rate for capital, or the “price of money.” The Fed controls America’s money supply. For now, recognize that capital is no different from apartments: The greater the supply, the cheaper the rent.\nThe Fed moves interest rates by making changes in the quantity of funds available to commercial banks. If banks are awash with money, then interest rates must be relatively low to attract borrowers for all the available funds.\nWhen capital is scarce, the opposite will be true: Banks can charge higher interest rates and still attract enough borrowers for all available funds. It is supply and demand, with the Fed controlling the supply.\n\nReference: Wheelan, C (2002). Naked economics : Undressing the dismal science. New York : Norton"

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are so accustomed to using money that we seldom notice the roles it plays in almost all of our everyday transactions. As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.\nMoney is an asset that is widely used and accepted as a means of payment.\n\nOnce upon a time, long before coins or bills, people traded goods to survive. A farmer would trade wheat for fish with a fisherman, but what happened when the fisherman didn’t need wheat? The world needed a better way.\nSo, humans invented money. First, it was shiny shells, then precious metals like gold and silver. Coins were stamped to show their value, making trade easier. Over time, people grew tired of carrying heavy coins, so paper money was born—promises of value backed by kings and governments.\nAs society advanced, money evolved further. Banks kept it safe, and people used checks instead of cash. Then came credit cards, making spending effortless. Today, money is often invisible—digital numbers in bank accounts, zipping around the world at the click of a button.\nMoney began as a simple solution to a problem, but now it shapes dreams, builds empires, and drives humanity forward, proving it’s more than just currency—it’s a symbol of trust and ambition.\n\n\n12.1.1 Money as a Medium of Exchange\n\nThe most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade—the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services.\nMoney eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable.\nA complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Money as a Unit of Account\n\nMoney’s second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value.\nPrices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries’ money prices into comparable terms.\nThe convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities.\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Money as a Store of Value\n\nBecause money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.\nMoney’s usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets.vSince money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.\n\n\n\n12.1.4 Why people trust money?\nPeople trust money because of a combination of social, legal, and psychological factors that have developed over time. Here’s why:\n\nGovernment Backing\n\nMost modern money, like paper currency, is issued by governments. People trust that the issuing authority (e.g., a central bank) will maintain its value and ensure its acceptance. For example, fiat money doesn’t have intrinsic value but is deemed valuable because the government declares it legal tender.\n\nSocial Consensus\n\nMoney works because everyone agrees to accept it as a medium of exchange. Trust in money is a collective belief reinforced by daily use—people trust it because others trust it, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\nHistorical Reliability\n\nOver time, money has proven to be a more reliable system than barter or other forms of trade. It has a track record of facilitating commerce, preserving wealth, and simplifying transactions.\n\nRegulation and Security\n\nLegal systems enforce the use and protection of money, such as laws against counterfeiting or theft. This regulation adds a layer of trust, as people feel confident that their money is protected and accepted within the system.\n\nScarcity and Stability\n\nCentral banks control the supply of money, ensuring it doesn’t lose value through excessive inflation. Trust grows when money maintains its purchasing power over time.\n\nSymbolism of Value\n\nMoney represents a claim on goods, services, or labor. Even if it’s just paper or digital code, people trust it because it symbolizes value that can be exchanged at any time.\n\nTechnological Advancement\n\nDigital systems, secure transactions, and transparent records (like blockchain for cryptocurrencies) have bolstered trust by reducing fraud and errors, making the handling of money more efficient.\nUltimately, trust in money is rooted in the stability of the systems behind it and the shared belief in its utility as a tool for trade, saving, and investment.\n\n\n12.1.5 How the Money Supply Is Determined\n\nAn economy’s money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks.\n\n\n\n12.1.6 Money Demand\n\nHow individual households and firms determine their demands for money? Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:\n\n\nThe interest rate: A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money.\nThe price level: The economy’s price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.\nReal national income: When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level.",

On September 11, 2001, hours after the terrorist attacks on the United States, the Federal Reserve issued the following statement: “The Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window is available to meet liquidity needs.”\nHow exactly does an inelegant two-sentence statement have such a profound effect on the world’s largest economy—indeed, on the whole global economy?\nThe Federal Reserve has tools with more direct impact on the global economy than any other institution in the world, public or private.\nFrom where does the Federal Reserve, an institution that is not directly accountable to the voting public, derive such power? And how does that power affect the lives of everyday Americans?\nThe answer to all those questions is the same: The Federal Reserve controls the money supply and therefore the credit tap for the economy.\nWhen that tap is open wide, interest rates fall and we spend more freely on things that require borrowed money—everything from new cars to new manufacturing plants. Thus, the Fed can use monetary policy to counteract economic downturns (or prevent them in the first place). And it can inject money into the financial system after sudden shocks, such as the 1987 stock market crash or the terrorist attacks of September 11 or the bursting of the American real estate bubble, when consumers and firms might otherwise freeze in place and stop spending.\nOr the Fed can tighten the tap by raising interest rates. When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power.\n\n\n13.4.1 Some paradox\n\nIf the Fed can make the economy grow faster by lowering interest rates, then presumably lower interest rates are always better. Indeed, why should there be any limit to the rate at which the economy can grow?\nIf we begin to spend more freely when rates are cut from 7 percent to 5 percent, why stop there? If there are still people without jobs and others without new cars, then let’s press on to 3 percent, or even 1 percent. New money for everyone!\nSadly, there are limits to how fast any economy can grow. If low interest rates, or “easy money,” causes consumers to demand 5 percent more new Jeep Cherokees than they purchased last year, then Chrysler must expand production by 5 percent. That means hiring more workers and buying more steel, glass, electrical components, etc. At some point, it becomes difficult or impossible for Chrysler to find these new inputs, particularly qualified workers. At that point, the company simply cannot make enough Jeep Cherokees to satisfy consumer demand; instead, the company begins to raise prices. Meanwhile, autoworkers recognize that Chrysler is desperate for labor, and the union demands higher wages."

For now, recognize that capital is no different from apartments: The greater the supply, the cheaper the rent.\nThe Fed moves interest rates by making changes in the quantity of funds available to commercial banks. If banks are awash with money, then interest rates must be relatively low to attract borrowers for all the available funds.\nWhen capital is scarce, the opposite will be true: Banks can charge higher interest rates and still attract enough borrowers for all available funds.

    "section": "",
    "text": "16.0.1 The gap between rich and poor\nWorld Bank classify the countries into four categories according to their level of income.\n\n\n\nTable: New World Bank country classifications by income level: 2022-2023\n\n\nThe World Bank assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income. The classifications are updated each year on July 1 and are based on the GNI per capita of the previous year (2021). GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nLow income: most sub-Saharan Africa, India, Pakistan\nLower-middle income: China, Caribbean countries\nUpper-middle income: Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Africa, Czech Republic\nHigh income: U.S., Singapore, France, Japan, Kuwait\n\n\n\n16.0.2 Has the world income gap narrowed over time?\nWhile some previously middle- and low-income economies have grown faster than high-income countries, and thus have “caught up” with high- income countries, others have languished. The income levels of high-income countries and some previously middle-income and low-income countries have converged. But the some of the poorest countries have had the lowest growth rates.\n\n16.0.2.1 Inequality within countries: Gini index\nThe Gini index is a measure of how equal a country’s distribution of income is. It is a score between 0 and 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. Perfect equality means a country’s total income is shared equally among its residents, whereas perfect inequality means a country’s total income is owned by a single individual.\nFor example, you can see that South Africa is (by this measure) the most unequal country in the world with a Gini index of 0.63\n\n\n16.0.2.2 Inequality between countries\nOver the last two decades global inequalities between countries have declined, income inequality has increased within most countries. Inequality varies significantly between the most equal region (Europe) and the most unequal (Middle East and North Africa i.e. “MENA”). In Europe, the top 10% income share is around 36%, whereas in “MENA” it reaches 58%. In between these two levels, we see a diversity of patterns. In East Asia, the top 10% makes 43% of total income and in Latin America, 55%.\n\n\n\nFigure: Income inequality levels across the regions\n\n\n\n\n16.0.2.3 How bad is extreme poverty globally?\nIt is true that ~700 million people around the world live on less than $1.90 USD per day. This forces people to make impossible choices for themselves and their families regarding healthcare, food, water, education, and housing. As a result, ~14,500 children under the age of five die every day from completely preventable causes, such as malaria, diarrhea, or malnutrition.\n\n\n16.0.2.4 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on income inequality\n2020 marked the steepest increase in the global billionaires’ share of wealth on record, the report found. Indeed, since 1995, the share of global wealth owned by billionaires’ has risen from 1% to over 3%.\n\n\n\n16.0.3 Structural features of developing countries\nWhat causes poverty is a difficult question, but low-income countries have at least some of following characteristics, which could contribute to poverty:\n\nGovernment control of the economy\n\n\nRestrictions on trade\nDirect control of production in industries and a high level of government purchases relative to GNP\nDirect control of financial transactions\nReduced competition reduces innovation; lack of market prices prevents efficient allocation of resources\n\n\nUnsustainable macroeconomic policies that cause high inflation and unstable output and employment\n\n\nIf governments cannot pay for debts through taxes, they can print money to finance debts.\nSeigniorage is paying for real goods and services by printing money.\nSeigniorage generally leads to high inflation.\nHigh inflation reduces the real cost of debt that the government has to repay and reduces the real value of repayments for lenders.\nHigh and variable inflation is costly to society; unstable output and employment is also costly.\n\n\nLack of financial markets that allow transfer of funds from savers to borrowers\n\n\nBanks frequently lend funds to poor or risky projects.\nLoans may be made on the basis of personal connections rather than prospective returns, and government safeguards against financial fragility, such as bank supervision, tend to be ineffective due to incompetence, inexperience, and outright fraud.\nUsually harder in developing countries for shareholders to find out how a firm’s money is being spent or to control firm managers.\nThe legal framework for resolving asset ownership in cases of bankruptcy typically is also weak.\n\n\nNatural resources or agricultural commodities make up an important share of exports for many developing countries.\n\n\nFor example, Russian petroleum, Malaysian timber, South African gold, and Colombian coffee.\n\n\nAttempts to circumvent government controls, taxes, and regulations have helped to make corrupt practices such as bribery and extortion a way of life in many developing countries.\n\n\nDue to government control of the economy and weak enforcement of economic laws and regulations, underground economies and corruption flourish.\n\n\n\n16.0.4 Developing-country borrowing and debt\nAnother common characteristic for many low- and middle-income countries is that they have traditionally borrowed from foreign countries.\n\nFinancial asset flows from foreign countries are able to finance investment projects, eventually leading to higher production and consumption.\nBut some investment projects fail and other borrowed funds are used primarily for consumption purposes.\nSome countries have defaulted on their foreign debts when the domestic economy stagnated or during financial crises.\nBut this trend has recently reversed as these countries have begun to save.\n\n\n\n16.0.5 The problem of default\n\nA financial crisis may involve\n\n\na debt crisis: an inability to repay sovereign (government) or private sector debt.\na balance of payments crisis.\na banking crisis: bankruptcy and other problems for private sector banks.\n\n\nA debt crisis in which governments default on their debt can be a self-fulfilling mechanism.\n\n\nFear of default reduces financial asset inflows and increases financial asset outflows (capital flight), decreasing investment and increasing interest rates, leading to low aggregate demand, output, and income.\nFinancial asset outflows must be matched with an increase in net exports or a decrease in official international reserves in order to pay individuals and institutions who desire foreign funds.\nOtherwise, the country cannot afford to pay those who want to remove their funds from the domestic economy.\nThe domestic government may have no choice but to default on its sovereign debt (paid for with foreign funds) when it comes due and when investors are unwilling to reinvest.\n\n\nIn general, a debt crisis can quickly magnify itself: it causes low income and high interest rates, which make government and private sector debts even harder to repay.\n\n\nHigh interest rates cause high interest payments for both the government and the private sector.\nLow income causes low tax revenue for the government.\nLow income makes loans made by private banks harder to repay: the default rate increases, which may cause bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n16.0.6 Alternative forms of financial inflow\n\nBond finance: government or private sector bonds are sold to foreign individuals and institutions.\nBank finance: commercial banks or securities firms lend to foreign governments or foreign businesses.\nOfficial lending: the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, or other official agencies lend to governments.\n\n\nSometimes these loans are made on a “concessional” or favorable basis, in which the interest rate is low.\n\n\nForeign direct investment: a firm directly acquires or expands operations in a subsidiary firm in a foreign country.\n\n\nA purchase by Ford of a subsidiary firm in Mexico is classified as foreign direct investment.\n\n\nPortfolio equity investment: a foreign investor purchases equity (stock) for his portfolio.\n\n\nPrivatization of government-owned firms in many countries has created more equity investment opportunities for foreign investors.\n\n\n\n16.0.7 The debt crisis of the 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, high interest rates and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused the burden of dollar-denominated debts in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile to increase drastically.\nA worldwide recession and a fall in many commodity prices also hurt export sectors in these countries.\nIn August 1982, Mexico announced that it could not repay its debts, mostly to private banks.\nThe U.S. government insisted that the private banks reschedule the debts, and in 1989\nMexico was able to achieve a reduction in the interest rate an extension of the repayment period a reduction in the principal by 12%\nBrazil, Argentina, and other countries were also allowed to reschedule their debts with private banks after they defaulted.\n\n\n\n16.0.8 East Asia: Success and crisis\n\nBefore the 1990s, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand relied mostly on domestic saving to finance investment.\nBut afterwards, foreign funds financed much of investment, and current account balances turned negative.\nDespite the rapid economic growth in East Asia between 1960 and 1997, growth was predicted to slow as economies “caught up” with Western countries.\n\n\n\n16.0.9 The Asian financial crises\n\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations and a lack of monitoring caused commercial firms, banks, and borrowers to engage in risky or even fraudulent activities: moral hazard.\nNonexistent or weakly enforced bankruptcy laws and loan contracts worsened problems after the crisis started.\nThe East Asian crisis started in Thailand in 1997, but quickly spread to other countries. Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines soon faced speculations about the value of their currencies.\nMost debts of banks and firms were denominated in U.S. dollars, so that devaluations of domestic currencies would make the burden of the debts in domestic currency increase.\nTo maintain fixed exchange rates would have required high interest rates and a reduction in government deficits, leading to a reduction in aggregate demand, output, and employment.\nAll of the affected economies except Malaysia turned to the IMF for loans to address the balance of payments crises and to maintain the value of the domestic currencies. Malaysia instead imposed controls on flows of financial assets so that it could increase its money supply (and lower interest rates), increase government purchases, and still try to maintain the value of the ringgit.\nBecause consumption and investment expenditure decreased with output, income, and employment, imports fell and the current account increased after 1997.\n\n\n\n16.0.10 Lessons of crises\n\nFixing the exchange rate has risks: governments desire to fix exchange rates to provide stability in the export and import sectors, but the price to pay may be high interest rates or high unemployment.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations can lead to risky investments and a banking crisis when a currency crisis erupts or when a fall in output, income, and employment occurs.\nLiberalizing financial asset flows without implementing sound financial regulations can lead to capital flight when investments lose value during a recession.\nThe importance of expectations: even healthy economies are vulnerable to crises when expectations change.\n\n\n\n16.0.11 Preventative (“prophylactic”) measures:\n\nBetter monitoring and more transparency: more information allows investors to make sound financial decisions in good and bad times.\nStronger enforcement of financial regulations: reduces moral hazard.\nDeposit insurance and reserve requirements.\nIncreased equity finance relative to debt finance.\nIncreased credit for troubled banks through central banks or the IMF?\n\n\n\n16.0.12 Summary\n\nSome countries have grown rapidly since 1960, but others have stagnated and remained poor.\nMany poor countries have extensive government control of the economy, unsustainable fiscal and monetary policies, lack of financial markets, weak enforcement of economic laws, a large amount of corruption, and low levels of education.\nMany developing economies have traditionally borrowed from international capital markets, and some have suffered from periodic sovereign debt crises, balance of payments crises, and banking crises.\nSovereign debt, balance of payments, and banking crises can be self-fulfilling, and each crisis can lead to another within a country or in another country.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nFixing exchange rates may lead to financial crises if the country is unwilling to restrict monetary and fiscal policies.\nWeak enforcement of financial regulations causes a moral hazard and may lead to a banking crisis, especially with free movement of financial assets.\nGeography and human capital may influence economic and political institutions, which in turn may affect long-term economic growth."

    "section": "6.2 The Cases Against Free Trade",
    "text": "6.2 The Cases Against Free Trade\n\n6.2.1 Question: How do governments intervene in international trade?\nThere are seven main instruments of trade policy\n\nTariffs\nSubsidies\nImport quotas\nVoluntary export restraints\nLocal content requirements\nAntidumping policies\nAdministrative policies\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Basic Tariff Analysis\nA tariff is a tax levied when a good is imported. There are various types of tariff.\n\nSpecific tariff are levied as a fixed charge for each unit of goods imported (for example, $3 per barrel of oil).\nAd valorem tariffs are taxes that are levied as a fraction of the value of the imported goods (for example, a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks).\n\nTariffs are the oldest form of trade policy and have traditionally been used as a source of government income. Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as:\n\nImport quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports)\nExport restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request).\n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies.\n\n\n6.2.3 Question: Why do governments impose tariffs?\n\nTariffs increase government revenues\nProvide protection to domestic producers against foreign competitors by increasing the cost of imported foreign goods\nForce consumers to pay more for certain imports\n\nTariffs are pro-producer and anti-consumer, and tariffs reduce the overall efficiency of the world economy",

    "text": "7.1.1 The Mercantilist Era (16th-18th Century)\n\nBilateral Treaties: As mercantilism dominated, nations pursued agreements to secure favorable terms of trade, often aiming to achieve a trade surplus.\n\n\n\n7.1.2 The Birth of Modern Trade (19th Century)\n\nCobden-Chevalier Treaty (1860): This Anglo-French agreement marked one of the first modern free trade agreements, reducing tariffs between the UK and France and influencing other nations to adopt similar measures.\nThe Gold Standard: Promoting stable exchange rates, the gold standard facilitated international trade during this period.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Interwar Period and Protectionism (1918-1945)\n\nThe Great Depression: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) in the United States led to retaliatory tariffs worldwide, severely contracting international trade. Under this act, tariff rates rose steeply and U.S. trade fell sharply; some economists argue that the Smoot-Hawley Act helped deepen the Great Depression.\nWithin a few years after the act’s passage, the U.S. administration concluded that tariffs needed to be reduced, but this posed serious problems of political coalition building.\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Post-World War II Era\n\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (1947): Established to prevent the protectionism that had plagued the interwar years, GATT aimed to reduce trade barriers through multilateral negotiations.\nA group of 23 countries began trade negotiations under a provisional set of rules that became known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. Officially, the GATT was an agreement, not an organization.\nIn 1995, the World Trade Organization, or WTO, was established, finally creating the formal organization envisaged 50 years earlier. However, the GATT rules remain in force, and the basic logic of the system remains the same.\n\n\n\n7.1.5 The WTO Era (1995-Present)\n\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO): The WTO replaced GATT, providing a more structured platform for resolving trade disputes and facilitating negotiations.\nProliferation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): Agreements like NAFTA (1994), now USMCA, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) exemplify efforts to enhance regional and global trade.",
